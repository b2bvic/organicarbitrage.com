### PASAIDA Element: Problem

---

You downloaded the calculator. Maybe ran a few models. Maybe even bid on a domain.

But the calculator only gets you 20% of the way there.

It tells you IF a domain is worth buying. Doesn't tell you WHERE to find undervalued domains before they hit crowded auctions. Doesn't tell you HOW to evaluate backlink quality beyond Ahrefs DR (which lies constantly). Doesn't tell you WHAT content strategy transfers authority fastest. Doesn't tell you WHEN to exit the position for maximum flip multiple.

That's the other 80%. Without it, you're either:

Skipping deals that would have been 10x wins because they looked weak on paper but had hidden monetization upside.

Buying domains that look good in the calculator but fail in execution because you didn't catch the spam links or the mismatched niche history.

Ranking successfully but monetizing poorly because you don't know how to extract maximum revenue before flipping.

I've spent 4 years and $67,000 buying expired domains. 31 were profitable (average 6.8x ROI). 16 failed ($18,000 total losses). Every play documented.

Monday at 9am ET, I'm releasing The Expired Domain Arbitrage Playbook. The full system: domain sourcing, valuation, acquisition, content strategy, monetization architecture, and exit preparation.

$297. Available for 48 hours (Monday 9am through Wednesday 9am ET). After that, it goes into the vault until next quarter.

If you're serious about treating expired domains as a repeatable arbitrage strategy instead of a gamble, this is the manual.

Details Monday morning.

## Email 2: The Playbook Is Open

**Send timing:** Day 2 (Monday 9am)
**Subject line:** [OPEN] The Expired Domain Arbitrage Playbook
**Preview text:** $297. Every framework I use to find, buy, build, and flip profitable aged domains.

### PASAIDA Element: Solution

---

The Playbook is live.

Here's what you get:

**Module 1: Domain Sourcing**

GoDaddy Auctions filtering strategy (the 7 metrics I check before clicking on a listing). Dynadot, NameJet, and dropcatch service comparison with cost/value analysis. Manual outreach to expiring domain owners with email templates that actually get responses. Monitoring competitor domain expirations with automation setup.

**Module 2: Valuation Framework**

Backlink quality scoring (spam detection, relevance weighting, penalty risk signals Ahrefs misses). Traffic history analysis using Archive.org combined with Ahrefs historical data. Niche-match assessment framework for deciding when to pivot vs. continue old niche. Penalty risk evaluation (Google Search Console signals, manual review triggers, toxicity thresholds). Bid ceiling calculation that prevents overpaying based on projected ROI.

**Module 3: Acquisition Tactics**

Auction bidding strategy (when to bid early to discourage competition vs. snipe at close). Negotiation templates for buy-it-now domains that save 15-30% off asking prices. Escrow setup and transfer process to avoid the scams that hit 20% of first-time domain buyers.

**Module 4: Post-Acquisition SEO**

Content strategy for aged domains: when to match old niche, when to pivot, when to do partial match. 301 redirect playbook with decision tree for redirect vs. rebuild scenarios. Link reclamation process for contacting sites with dead links to old domain. Indexing speed optimization (sitemap submission timing, internal linking structure, crawl budget allocation).

**Module 5: Monetization Architecture**

Ad network setup with Mediavine and AdThrive threshold strategies and RPM optimization tactics. Affiliate program selection by niche with spreadsheet comparing commission rates, cookie durations, and conversion rates. Lead gen funnels for B2B niches with email capture and nurture sequence templates. Traffic quality segmentation (bottom-funnel transactional content vs. top-funnel list building).

**Module 6: Exit Preparation**

When to flip vs. hold (12-month quick flip strategy vs. 36-month value build). Pre-sale optimization sprint (30-day revenue maximization, traffic cleanup, documentation standards). Marketplace selection decision tree (Flippa vs. Empire Flippers vs. Motion Invest vs. private sale). Listing strategy and negotiation tactics that increase sale multiples by 1.5-2x.

**Module 7: Case Studies**

10 real plays with full P&Ls:
- $180 acquisition to $9,200 revenue (18-month hold, Mediavine monetization)
- $600 acquisition to $12,000 flip (12-month hold, affiliate site)
- $1,200 acquisition to $0 (failed play, penalty risk, full autopsy)
- 7 more with traffic screenshots, revenue proof, lessons extracted

**Bonuses:**

Advanced version of the Arbitrage Calculator with automation for batch domain evaluation. Backlink Quality Audit Checklist (50-point evaluation that catches problems Ahrefs DR hides). Content Strategy Template that maps old domain topics to new content with keyword integration. Auction Bidding Tracker that monitors multiple auctions and alerts before close.

**Price: $297**
**Available: 48 hours (closes Wednesday 9am ET)**

## Email 3: The 3 Mistakes That Kill Expired Domain Plays

**Send timing:** Day 2 (Monday 4pm)
**Subject line:** Yes, but not the way most people try
**Preview text:** The 3 mistakes that kill expired domain plays (and how to avoid them)

### PASAIDA Element: Agitation

---

"Isn't expired domain SEO dead? Didn't Google kill it?"

Short answer: No. Google killed spam expired domain plays. They didn't kill strategic aged domain acquisition.

Here's what died:

Buying random expired domains with high DR and spamming affiliate content. Google got good at detecting content that doesn't match domain history.

Ignoring niche relevance and hoping domain authority alone ranks you. Authority transfer has become increasingly topic-dependent since 2023.

Building PBNs with expired domains. This triggers penalties within 6 months now, sometimes faster.

Here's what still works:

Buying expired domains with clean backlink profiles in relevant niches. Matching new content to old domain topics to transfer authority smoothly. Monetizing with legitimate ad networks and affiliate programs.

The difference is discipline. You can't spray and pray anymore. You need:

**Niche relevance.** Domain history must match new content direction. Home improvement domain goes to home improvement content. Not home improvement to crypto. Not finance blog to recipe site. Google tracks topical continuity.

**Backlink quality.** 400 clean referring domains beats 4,000 spam links. Ahrefs DR doesn't distinguish. 60% of the domains I see at auction have backlink profiles that look good in DR but fall apart under manual review. The Playbook includes my 50-point audit checklist.

**Monetization clarity.** Know your revenue model before you buy. Ad-based monetization needs high-RPM niches (finance at $35+, home improvement at $28+, B2B SaaS at $40+). Affiliate needs programs with decent commissions in the exact subtopic. Lead gen needs businesses actively paying for leads.

I've bought 47 expired domains. 31 were profitable because they followed these three rules. 16 failed because they violated at least one.

The operators making money with expired domains in 2026 are running this like a business: sourcing, modeling, acquiring, building, monetizing, exiting. They're not buying DR 50 domains and hoping.

The Playbook walks through every step. If you've been burned by expired domains before, it's probably because you skipped one of the three rules above. The system forces you to check all three before you bid.

## Email 4: Steal My Entire System

**Send timing:** Day 3 (Tuesday 9am)
**Subject line:** Steal my expired domain system (templates included)
**Preview text:** Every spreadsheet, checklist, and email template I use

### PASAIDA Element: Authority + Incentive

---

You don't need to figure this out from scratch.

I've made the mistakes already. Lost $18,000 on bad plays. Spent 4 years testing domain sources, valuation models, content strategies, monetization tactics.

The Playbook gives you the exact system I use now.

**You get my domain sourcing checklist.** The 7 filters I apply in GoDaddy Auctions before I even click on a listing. This eliminates 90% of domains in 30 seconds. Saves hours of evaluation time on domains that would never pass valuation anyway.

**You get my valuation spreadsheet.** Input domain metrics, backlink data, niche monetization rates. Output is max bid price and projected ROI. Same sheet I used for the $400 to $9,200 play. Updated version includes batch processing for evaluating 20+ domains at once.

**You get my backlink audit template.** 50-point checklist for evaluating link quality. Catches spam, PBN links, and penalty risks that Ahrefs DR doesn't show. Takes 15 minutes per domain. Has saved me from at least 8 bad purchases that looked good on surface metrics.

**You get my content strategy template.** Maps old domain topics to new content. Ensures niche relevance and authority transfer. Includes keyword research integration so you're targeting terms the old domain had history with.

**You get my outreach email templates.** For contacting expiring domain owners (often buy at 30-50% below auction prices). For negotiating buy-it-now listings. For reclaiming dead backlinks post-acquisition (free link building from relationships the old domain already established).

**You get my auction bidding tracker.** Google Sheets tool that monitors multiple auctions, calculates bid ceilings based on your valuation inputs, and alerts you before close so you don't miss good deals or get swept up in bidding wars.

**You get my exit prep checklist.** 30-day sprint to maximize revenue and clean up site before listing on Flippa or Empire Flippers. The checklist items that increase sale multiples by 1.5-2x are the ones most sellers skip.

These aren't theories. These are the actual tools I open every time I evaluate a domain, bid on an auction, or prepare a site for sale.

You can spend 2 years building your own system and losing money on mistakes. Or you can copy mine for $297 and skip straight to profitable plays.

## Email 5: The Math on Why This Works

**Send timing:** Day 3 (Tuesday 4pm)
**Subject line:** 12 hours left on The Playbook
**Preview text:** Closing Wed 9am ET. Here's why I'm not keeping it open.

### PASAIDA Element: Deadline

---

The Expired Domain Arbitrage Playbook closes Wednesday at 9am ET. 12 hours from now.

After that, it goes off-sale until next quarter. No exceptions, no extensions.

Why the 48-hour window?

I'm not running an evergreen course business. I'm running a membership and research service for operators who want ongoing arbitrage opportunities, not just one-time education.

The Playbook is a foundation. It teaches the system. But the real long-term value is the Monthly Arbitrage Opportunity Reports ($97/month membership launching February). Those reports will show you specific domains, keywords, and niches with high spread potential as I find them.

If you don't have the foundational system (sourcing, valuation, execution), the monthly reports won't help. You'll see opportunities but won't know how to evaluate or execute them.

So the Playbook is available in short windows (48 hours per quarter). Filters for operators serious enough to act fast. Those are the people who will get value from the ongoing research.

If you're on the fence, here's the math:

Average ROI on my 31 successful expired domain plays: 6.8x

If you buy ONE domain using the Playbook system and hit even 3x ROI (half my average), you've paid for the Playbook and profited.

If you avoid ONE bad domain purchase (like the 16 I failed on before building this system), you've saved $500-$2,000 in wasted acquisition costs.

The Playbook pays for itself in one good decision or one avoided mistake.

12 hours.

## Email 7: The Playbook Is Closed

**Send timing:** Day 4 (Wednesday 10am)
**Subject line:** The Playbook is closed
**Preview text:** Thanks to everyone who grabbed it. Here's what's next.

### PASAIDA Element: Action (Post-Close Follow-Up)

---

The Expired Domain Arbitrage Playbook is now closed.

If you grabbed it: check your inbox for access credentials. You'll receive login details within 10 minutes. If you don't see them, check spam and reply to this email.

If you missed it: the Playbook reopens Q2 2026 (April). I'll announce the launch 48 hours in advance. Stay subscribed for the reminder.

**What's next:**

Two things I'm working on.

**Monthly Arbitrage Opportunity Reports (launching February 2026).** Live research each month: specific expired domains hitting auctions with high spread potential, undervalued keywords with strong monetization, parasite SEO plays on platforms before windows close, programmatic content opportunities in emerging niches. $97/month membership. I'll send details in 2 weeks.

**The Parasite SEO Economics Playbook (launching March 2026).** Complete system for profiting from high-authority platforms (Medium, LinkedIn, Reddit, Substack). Same format as the Expired Domain Playbook: frameworks, templates, case studies showing real P&Ls. $197. Another 48-hour launch window.

For now, you'll keep getting weekly insights on SEO arbitrage, traffic valuation, and operator-focused strategies. No fluff. No listicles. Frameworks and data.

If you want case studies on specific niches, reply with what you're working on. I prioritize based on what subscribers want to see.

Victor

P.S. — The February membership launch will include early-bird pricing for subscribers who've been on this list since the beginning. You'll hear about it before anyone else.
