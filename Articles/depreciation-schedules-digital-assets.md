# Depreciation Schedules for Digital Assets: Tax Treatment of Website Acquisitions

A website purchased for $120,000 generates $3,500 monthly profit. Standard 15-year intangible asset depreciation deducts $8,000 annually, reducing taxable income. But optimal tax treatment requires understanding which components depreciate over 15 years, which expense immediately, and how purchase price allocation affects deductions.

**Depreciation schedules for digital assets** determine how quickly you recover acquisition costs through tax deductions. The IRS classifies acquired websites as **Section 197 intangibles**—amortizable over 15 years. But within that classification, specific assets (customer lists, content libraries, software) follow different treatment rules. Sophisticated operators allocate purchase price across components to maximize early deductions.

This isn't aggressive tax avoidance. It's proper classification using IRS code. Most website buyers take the simple approach—depreciate the entire purchase price over 15 years. They leave money on the table. Proper allocation accelerates deductions by 20-40%, reducing cash taxes in years 1-5 when capital is typically constrained.

## Section 197 Intangibles: The Default Framework

When you acquire a website as a going concern (with traffic, revenue, customer lists, content), the IRS treats it as an intangible asset under **Section 197**. This includes:

- Domain name (intangible property)
- Content library (copyright)
- Customer/subscriber lists (customer-based intangible)
- Backlink profile (goodwill)
- Brand reputation (goodwill)

Section 197 requires **15-year straight-line amortization**. No accelerated depreciation. No bonus depreciation. You deduct 1/15th of the purchase price annually for 15 years.

Example:

- Purchase price: $150,000
- Annual depreciation: $150,000 / 15 = $10,000
- Monthly deduction: $833

If you're in 32% effective tax bracket (federal + state), that $10,000 annual deduction saves $3,200 in taxes. Over 15 years, you'll recover $48,000 in tax savings from a $150,000 investment—the rest comes from operational profits.

This default treatment is straightforward but suboptimal. By allocating purchase price to specific asset components, you can accelerate deductions significantly.

## Purchase Price Allocation: Breaking Down the Asset

The IRS allows (and expects) purchase price allocation across identifiable assets. When buying a website, you're acquiring multiple distinct components:

**1. Domain Name (Section 197, 15-year)**

The domain itself is an intangible asset. Typically 5-10% of purchase price for established sites. If the domain has strong brand value or exact-match keyword (e.g., BestColdPlunge.com for cold plunge niche), allocate 8-12%. Generic or new domains: 3-5%.

**2. Content Library (Copyrights, 15-year or immediate expense)**

Articles, videos, graphics constitute copyrighted works. The IRS treats these as Section 197 intangibles (15-year) when acquired as part of a business. However, individual content pieces can potentially be expensed immediately under de minimis safe harbor if valued under $2,500 each.

Allocation: 20-30% of purchase price for content-heavy sites (200+ articles). Content's value derives from its ranking and traffic generation—it's the core revenue driver.

**3. Customer/Subscriber Lists (Section 197, 15-year)**

Email lists and customer databases are specifically listed in Section 197. Allocate based on subscriber count and engagement. An engaged 10,000-subscriber list might justify 10-15% of purchase price. A cold 5,000-subscriber list: 3-5%.

**4. Software and Tools (7-year property under MACRS)**

If the acquisition includes proprietary software, plugins, or custom tools (e.g., a custom WordPress theme, automated posting tools, scraping scripts), these may qualify as **software** under IRC 167(f)(1), depreciable over **36 months** (3 years) instead of 15 years.

Many website acquisitions ignore this. If the seller built custom tools or you're acquiring a SaaS component alongside content, allocate 5-15% to software and depreciate over 3 years. This accelerates deductions dramatically compared to 15-year treatment.

**5. Goodwill and Going Concern Value (Section 197, 15-year)**

The residual—everything not allocated to specific assets—falls into goodwill. This includes brand reputation, ranking positions, backlink profile, operational systems. Typically 40-60% of purchase price for established sites.

## Optimal Allocation Strategy

Maximize early-year deductions by allocating more purchase price to assets with shorter depreciation periods or immediate expensing opportunities:

**Step 1: Identify software or technology components**

Did the seller include custom WordPress plugins, automation scripts, or proprietary tools? These qualify for 3-year depreciation. Allocate as much as defensibly possible to software—aim for 10-15% if software exists. Document what qualifies (installation files, code repositories, licensing).

**Step 2: Value customer lists conservatively**

Email lists are valuable but subjective to value. Allocate 8-12% for engaged lists (20%+ open rates, generates revenue). Defend valuation with email platform data (subscriber count, engagement metrics, revenue attribution).

**Step 3: Allocate to content library**

20-30% for sites with 150+ articles. Less for thin portfolios (under 50 articles). Content is core asset—justify high allocation with traffic attribution (X% of traffic comes from organic content, therefore content is worth X% of purchase price).

**Step 4: Minimize goodwill allocation**

Goodwill is the catch-all for unspecified value. Lower goodwill allocation = more value in specific, documentable assets. Aim for 40-50% goodwill, not 70-80%. The IRS scrutinizes allocations that stray from norms, but 40% goodwill is defensible if you document other assets well.

**Example allocation for $150,000 purchase:**

- Domain name: $9,000 (6%, 15-year)
- Content library: $40,000 (27%, 15-year)
- Email list: $15,000 (10%, 15-year)
- Custom software/tools: $18,000 (12%, 3-year)
- Goodwill: $68,000 (45%, 15-year)

**Annual depreciation:**

- Domain + content + email + goodwill: $142,000 / 15 = $9,467/year
- Software: $18,000 / 3 = $6,000/year
- **Total first-year deduction: $15,467** (vs. $10,000 under simple 15-year treatment)

That's a $5,467 additional deduction in year one. At 32% tax rate, you save an extra $1,750 in taxes immediately. This difference compounds over the first three years as software continues depreciating faster.

## De Minimis Safe Harbor: Immediate Expensing Opportunity

The IRS allows businesses to **immediately expense** items costing under $2,500 (per item or invoice) instead of depreciating them over time, under **de minimis safe harbor** rules (IRC Reg. 1.263(a)-1(f)).

Can individual articles qualify? Potentially. If you purchase a site's content piecemeal or if the seller provides invoices showing per-article costs under $2,500, you might expense those immediately instead of capitalizing and depreciating.

**The strategy:**

If buying directly from a seller who commissioned content via Upwork/Fiverr and has invoices showing each article cost $150-400, request those invoices as part of acquisition documents. Allocate purchase price to individual articles at their production cost (totaling 20-30% of purchase price). Expense those immediately under de minimis rules rather than depreciating over 15 years.

This is aggressive and requires documentation. The IRS might challenge if you expense $40,000 of individual content immediately, arguing the content was acquired as a bundle (not individual items). But if you have invoices supporting per-article valuation under $2,500 each, the defense exists.

Conservative approach: Allocate content to Section 197 and depreciate over 15 years. Aggressive approach: Attempt de minimis expensing with strong documentation. Consult your CPA—risk tolerance varies.

## Bonus Depreciation and Section 179: Limited Applicability

**Bonus depreciation** (100% first-year expensing for qualified property) and **Section 179 expensing** apply primarily to tangible property and certain software. Websites, as intangible assets, generally don't qualify.

However, if your acquisition includes **tangible assets**—computers, servers, office equipment used to operate the site—those qualify for bonus depreciation. If you purchase a site for $150,000 and the seller includes two Mac computers and a server ($8,000 value), allocate that $8,000 to equipment and immediately expense it under bonus depreciation.

Most website acquisitions are purely intangible (domain, content, traffic). But portfolio operators sometimes acquire "business in a box" deals including equipment. Don't miss the opportunity to immediately expense tangible components.

## State Tax Considerations

State tax treatment of intangible assets varies:

**States that follow federal treatment (most states):**

If your federal return depreciates the website over 15 years, state return does the same. No additional planning required.

**States with addback rules (New York, New Jersey, others):**

Some states require "addback" of certain intangible asset amortization, reducing or eliminating the state tax deduction even though federal deduction exists. If operating in an addback state, the effective tax benefit of depreciation declines because you lose state deductions.

**States with favorable intangible treatment (Nevada, Wyoming, Florida):**

These states have no corporate or personal income tax. Depreciation benefits apply only federally. If you operate through a Nevada LLC but live in California, you get federal deductions but California still taxes the income (since you're a CA resident). The LLC state matters less than your residency for pass-through entities.

Consult a CPA familiar with your state's rules. Depreciation strategy that works federally might not optimize state taxes, or vice versa.

## Sale and Recapture Implications

When you eventually sell a website, **depreciation recapture** affects capital gains tax:

If you depreciated $40,000 over 5 years then sell for $180,000 (original purchase $150,000):

- Sale price: $180,000
- Adjusted basis: $110,000 ($150,000 - $40,000 depreciation taken)
- Capital gain: $70,000
- **Recapture of depreciation: $40,000** (taxed at ordinary income rates, up to 37%)
- **Remaining gain: $30,000** (taxed at long-term capital gains rates, 15-20%)

Depreciation recapture means the IRS "recaptures" the tax benefit you received earlier by taxing that portion at ordinary rates rather than favorable capital gains rates. You're not double-taxed—you just repay the benefit, with timing arbitrage (you got deductions at high ordinary rates in early years, pay recapture at same rates at exit).

**Strategic implication:**

Depreciation is a **timing benefit**, not an elimination of taxes. You defer taxes from operating years to exit year. This is valuable if:

- You expect to be in a lower tax bracket at exit (e.g., you retire before selling)
- You hold the asset long-term and benefit from time value of money (tax savings today worth more than tax recapture in 10 years)
- You plan 1031 exchange or other deferral mechanisms at exit (advanced strategy, consult CPA)

Don't avoid depreciation due to recapture fear. The timing arbitrage and cash flow benefits almost always outweigh recapture downside.

## Documentation and Audit Defense

Proper documentation protects allocation decisions during IRS audits:

**Required documentation:**

**1. Purchase Agreement with Allocation Schedule**

Include an asset allocation schedule in the purchase agreement or as an addendum. Both buyer and seller should sign, acknowledging the allocation. This creates legal record that both parties agreed to the valuation breakdown.

**2. Appraisal or Valuation Report**

For purchases above $100,000, consider hiring a business appraiser to value individual components (domain, content, customer list, software). Cost: $1,500-3,000. This third-party validation defends aggressive allocations during audits.

**3. Seller's Historical Cost Data**

Request invoices showing the seller's content production costs, software development costs, and email list building expenses. Use these to justify allocation amounts. If seller spent $45,000 building the content library, allocating $40,000 of purchase price to content (27% of $150,000) is defensible.

**4. Traffic and Revenue Attribution**

Pull Google Analytics and revenue reports showing what percentage of traffic/revenue comes from content vs. email list vs. other sources. If 65% of traffic comes from organic content, allocating 27% of purchase price to content (less than traffic contribution) is conservative and defensible.

**5. Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement)**

IRS requires Form 8594 for business acquisitions exceeding $100,000. Both buyer and seller file, reporting the agreed allocation across asset classes (Class I-VII). Discrepancies between buyer and seller filings trigger IRS scrutiny. Ensure both parties file consistent allocations.

Store all documentation with your tax records. If audited, you'll need to defend allocations 3-5 years later. Clear documentation makes this straightforward.

## Special Considerations for Portfolio Operators

Operating multiple websites affects depreciation strategy:

**Aggregation rules:** If you purchase 3 websites in one calendar year for a combined $250,000, the IRS may treat this as one transaction for depreciation purposes if the sites are related (same niche, same seller, bundled deal). Allocate across all three sites in aggregate, not individually. This might require a single large appraisal covering all assets.

**Partial dispositions:** If you sell one site from your portfolio, you can claim a **partial disposition** loss for undepreciated basis. Example: You bought a site for $80,000, depreciated $20,000 over 4 years (remaining basis: $60,000), then sell for $70,000. You have a $10,000 gain on sale, but you also accelerate the remaining $60,000 depreciation (rather than continuing to depreciate over 11 more years). Consult CPA on executing partial disposition elections properly.

**Portfolio-level goodwill:** If you operate sites under a unified brand or entity, goodwill may aggregate at portfolio level rather than individual site level. This complicates allocation on sale of individual sites. Consider operating sites in separate LLCs to maintain clean asset segregation for tax purposes.

## FAQ

**Can you re-depreciate a website you already own if its value increases?**

No. Depreciation basis is your purchase cost plus improvements (capital expenditures like major redesigns, new software). Increases in market value don't reset depreciation. If you bought for $100,000 and it's now worth $180,000, you continue depreciating the original $100,000 basis. The $80,000 appreciation is unrealized until sale.

**What if you build a site yourself—can you depreciate your labor and content costs?**

No. Your own labor isn't depreciable—it's sweat equity. Content production costs can be either expensed immediately (if under $2,500 per article or treated as ordinary business expense) or capitalized and depreciated. Most operators expense content costs as incurred rather than capitalizing. You only depreciate when you *acquire* assets from others, not when you create them yourself. Different tax treatment for creators vs. acquirers.

**Does paying earnout or seller financing affect depreciation timeline?**

No. Depreciation starts based on purchase price agreed at acquisition, regardless of payment structure. If you pay $150,000 via $100,000 upfront + $50,000 earnout over 18 months, you begin depreciating the full $150,000 immediately (assuming earnout is guaranteed or likely). You don't wait until earnout is paid to depreciate that portion.

**Can you accelerate depreciation by selling a site to yourself (transferring between entities)?**

The IRS disallows this for related-party transactions. If you sell from your personal ownership to your LLC (entities you control), the IRS treats it as non-recognition event—no new depreciation basis. Selling between unrelated parties resets depreciation. Selling between your own entities does not. Don't attempt to manufacture depreciation through self-dealing.

**What happens if the IRS audits and disagrees with your allocation?**

The IRS can recharacterize allocations (e.g., reduce software allocation, increase goodwill allocation) and assess back taxes on disallowed depreciation. If your allocation was reasonable and documented, adjustments are minor. If allocation was aggressive with weak documentation, the IRS might disallow most of it. Penalties apply if allocation is deemed fraudulent (intentional misrepresentation), but not if it's merely incorrect but defensible. Audit risk increases with purchase price—under $100,000, very low audit risk; above $500,000, moderate risk. Document accordingly.
