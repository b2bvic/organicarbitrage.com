# Mediavine vs AdThrive vs Raptive: Premium Ad Network Revenue Comparison

**Mediavine vs AdThrive vs Raptive** comparison reveals 15-35% RPM differences favoring **AdThrive** for sites with 750,000+ monthly pageviews ($42-58 RPM) and **Mediavine** for sites with 50,000-400,000 pageviews ($28-38 RPM), while **Raptive** occupies middle ground with selective approval criteria emphasizing content quality over pure traffic volume. Most operators default to whichever network accepts their application without modeling revenue differences—leaving $800-2,500 monthly on the table through suboptimal network selection. Your choice should weigh RPM expectations, traffic eligibility, and contract lock-in periods against switching costs.

## Traffic Requirements and Approval Criteria

**Mediavine minimum:** 50,000 sessions monthly (not pageviews—sessions are typically 60-75% of pageview count). A site with 65,000 monthly pageviews averaging 1.3 pages per session meets the 50,000 session threshold.

**AdThrive minimum:** Historically 100,000 monthly pageviews, expanded to accept some sites at 50,000-75,000 pageviews in specific verticals (food, lifestyle, parenting) where they see high engagement. Approval is discretionary—meeting traffic minimum doesn't guarantee acceptance.

**Raptive (formerly CafeMedia) minimum:** 100,000 monthly pageviews, but approval emphasizes content quality, engagement metrics (time on site >90 seconds, bounce rate <70%), and niche fit. Raptive rejects sites meeting traffic thresholds if content quality appears thin or engagement signals weak.

**Verification requirements:**
All three networks require Google Analytics integration for traffic verification. Expect 7-14 day review periods. AdThrive conducts manual site reviews checking for:
- Traffic source composition (organic >60% preferred, paid traffic scrutinized)
- Content originality (duplicate content flags rejections)
- User experience (intrusive popups, autoplay videos reduce approval chances)

**Rejection pathways:**
- **Traffic quality issues:** Bot traffic, click farms, low engagement
- **Content policy violations:** Adult content, illegal content, excessive profanity
- **UX problems:** Deceptive ads, malware, excessive ad density before network integration
- **Niche restrictions:** Mediavine and AdThrive avoid certain verticals (gambling, weapons, controversial politics)

- **Mediavine:** $40-55 RPM (high CPM categories)
- **AdThrive:** $45-68 RPM (premium finance advertisers)
- **Raptive:** $35-50 RPM

**Lifestyle and parenting:**
- **Mediavine:** $24-35 RPM
- **AdThrive:** $28-42 RPM
- **Raptive:** $22-34 RPM

**Tech and SaaS:**
- **Mediavine:** $28-40 RPM
- **AdThrive:** $32-48 RPM
- **Raptive:** $26-38 RPM

Tech niches see above-average RPMs but below finance/food due to ad blocker prevalence (30-50% of tech audiences use ad blockers vs 8-15% for food/lifestyle).

## Payment Terms and Cash Flow

**Mediavine payment schedule:**
- **Threshold:** $25 minimum
- **Timing:** Net-65 (earnings from January paid March 1)
- **Method:** Direct deposit or PayPal

A site earning $8,000 monthly receives $8,000 cash 35 days earlier = ~$230 value monthly through earlier reinvestment.

## Contract Terms and Switching Costs

**Mediavine contract:**
- **Term:** Month-to-month after initial 30-day integration period
- **Termination:** 30-day notice required
- **Exclusivity:** Cannot run competing display ad networks simultaneously

**AdThrive contract:**
- **Term:** 12-month minimum commitment
- **Termination:** Auto-renews annually, 60-day notice required
- **Exclusivity:** Cannot run competing networks, restricts affiliate ad placements

**Raptive contract:**
- **Term:** Month-to-month
- **Termination:** 30-day notice
- **Exclusivity:** Standard display ad exclusivity

**Switching friction:**
- **Technical setup:** 8-15 hours integrating new ad tags, testing placements, optimizing layouts
- **Revenue loss during transition:** 7-14 days of reduced RPMs as new network's systems learn site's audience
- **Opportunity cost:** If current network generates $0.15 less per pageview than alternative, switching breaks even after 2-3 months

**Break-even calculation:**
Site earning $12,000 monthly on Mediavine considering switch to AdThrive expecting $15,000 monthly:
- **Gain:** $3,000 monthly
- **Switching cost:** 40 hours labor at $75/hour = $3,000 + $1,500 revenue loss during transition = $4,500 total
- **Break-even:** 1.5 months
- **12-month gain:** $31,500 ($36,000 gained - $4,500 switching cost)

## Video Content Monetization

**Mediavine video player:**
- **Video RPM:** $45-75 for sites with embedded video content
- **In-content video ads:** Automatically inserts video players into articles
- **Revenue split:** Favorable to publisher (90/10 split on video ads)

**AdThrive video:**
- **Video RPM:** $50-85 (slight edge over Mediavine)
- **Requires:** Manual video uploads or YouTube embeds
- **Integration:** More technical setup vs Mediavine's automatic insertion

**Raptive video:**
- **Video RPM:** $40-70
- **Basic integration** without Mediavine's sophisticated auto-insertion

For sites producing video content (cooking tutorials, product reviews), Mediavine's automatic video player integration adds $2,000-6,000 monthly revenue vs text-only content. AdThrive matches or exceeds performance but requires more manual video production.

**Geographic composition matters:** A site with 60% US traffic, 20% UK/Canada, 20% rest-of-world earns blended $32 RPM on AdThrive vs $28 RPM on Mediavine. A site with 30% US, 70% international earns $21 RPM on AdThrive vs $18 RPM on Mediavine—gap narrows with higher international traffic percentage.

## Site Speed and User Experience Impact

**Mediavine optimization:**
- **Lazy loading:** Ads load as user scrolls (reduces initial page load)
- **Script wrapper:** Consolidates ad requests into single async call
- **Typical impact:** 0.2-0.8 second slower vs no ads, 0.3-0.6 seconds faster vs AdSense

**AdThrive optimization:**
- **Header bidding:** Advanced auction system maximizing CPMs

## FAQ

### Can you switch between networks without losing traffic?

Yes—ad networks don't impact organic rankings. Switching affects revenue during 7-14 day transition as the new network's algorithms learn your audience, typically seeing 10-20% RPM reduction that recovers within 2-3 weeks. Use 30-day rolling average to evaluate new network performance rather than judging after first week.

### Do premium networks require exclusive contracts?

All three require display ad exclusivity—you can't run Mediavine and AdThrive simultaneously. However, you can run affiliate ads, sponsored content, email monetization, and other revenue streams alongside the network. AdThrive's contract is most restrictive (limits certain affiliate placements), Mediavine and Raptive allow standard affiliate integrations.

### Should you join Mediavine at 50K pageviews or wait for AdThrive at 100K?

Join Mediavine immediately—the 40-80% RPM improvement vs AdSense generates $1,000-2,000 monthly that compounds into faster growth. Waiting 3-6 months to reach AdThrive's threshold costs $3,000-12,000 in lost revenue. Switch to AdThrive later if RPM gains justify switching costs (typically 15-25% higher RPMs at 100K+ pageviews).

### How do RPMs vary by season?

Q4 (Oct-Dec) RPMs run 40-80% higher than Q1 (Jan-Mar) due to holiday advertising spend. Example: Site earning $30 RPM in February sees $42-54 RPM in November-December. Budget annual revenue using monthly averages, not extrapolating peak months. Q4 generates 35-45% of annual revenue despite being 25% of the year.

### What traffic quality issues cause RPM drops?

Bot traffic, incentivized traffic (paid clicks), accidental traffic (misleading headlines), and low-engagement traffic (high bounce rates >80%, time on site <30 seconds) all suppress RPMs by 30-60%. Networks detect quality issues through engagement signals and may warn publishers or terminate contracts if issues persist. Focus on organic search and social traffic with 60+ second time on site for optimal RPMs.
