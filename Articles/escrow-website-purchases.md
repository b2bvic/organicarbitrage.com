# Escrow Website Purchases — Protecting Buyers and Sellers in Asset Transfers

**Escrow services** eliminate counterparty risk in website transactions by holding funds until asset transfer completes. A buyer deposits **$300,000** into **Escrow.com**, the seller transfers the domain, hosting, Google Analytics, and ad network accounts, the buyer verifies traffic and revenue, and escrow releases funds to the seller. Neither party risks losing money or assets.

Without escrow, buyers face **payment-then-no-delivery fraud** (send $300K, seller disappears). Sellers face **delivery-then-no-payment fraud** (transfer domain, buyer disputes payment). **Escrow.com** (industry standard for website sales) mediates 95% of transactions over $50K because both parties gain protection.

Escrow costs **0.89-3.25% of transaction value** ($2,670-$9,750 on a $300K sale) but prevents **100% loss risk** ($300K). The insurance value justifies the fee. Transactions under $50K sometimes use **PayPal**, but PayPal disputes favor buyers 70-80% of the time, creating seller risk.

## How Escrow Works

**Standard escrow timeline** (30-60 days total):

**Phase 1: Agreement (Day 1-3)**
- Buyer and seller agree on price, terms, asset list
- Escrow instructions drafted (defines what "completed transfer" means)
- Both parties sign escrow agreement

**Phase 2: Funding (Day 4-7)**
- Buyer deposits funds to Escrow.com via wire transfer
- Escrow confirms receipt, notifies seller
- Seller begins asset transfer

**Phase 3: Asset Transfer (Day 8-35)**
- Domain transferred (5-7 days for domain unlock, auth code, registrar transfer)
- Hosting migrated (2-5 days for site export, DNS propagation)
- Google Analytics ownership transferred (1-2 days)
- Google Search Console ownership transferred (1-2 days)
- Ad network accounts transferred (Mediavine 14-21 days, AdThrive 7-14 days)
- Affiliate accounts transferred or buyer applies fresh (Amazon requires new account)
- Email list transferred (1-3 days via email platform account ownership or CSV export)

**Phase 4: Verification (Day 36-50)**
- Buyer verifies traffic matches seller claims (compare 30 days pre-sale to 30 days post-transfer)
- Buyer verifies revenue matches seller claims (check ad network payments, affiliate commissions)
- Buyer tests site functionality (broken links, redirects, image loading)
- Buyer confirms access to all assets (logins, passwords, API keys)

**Phase 5: Release (Day 51-60)**
- Buyer approves transfer (clicks "Accept" in Escrow.com dashboard)
- Escrow releases funds to seller (wire transfer, 1-3 business days)
- Escrow fee deducted from buyer or seller (per agreement, typically buyer pays)

**Dispute scenario**: Buyer reports **traffic down 40%** during verification. Escrow freezes release. Buyer and seller negotiate:
- Seller provides evidence (Google algorithm update caused industry-wide traffic drop)
- Buyer accepts explanation, approves release at reduced price ($300K → $260K)
- OR Escrow initiates dispute resolution (mediator reviews data, assigns fault)

[Empire Flippers review sellers](empire-flippers-review-sellers.html) explains how **Empire Flippers coordinates escrow** and mediates disputes to prevent deal fallthrough.

## Escrow.com Fee Structure

**Escrow.com charges** based on transaction value:

| Transaction Amount | Escrow Fee (Buyer Pays) | Fee Amount |
|--------------------|-------------------------|------------|
| $5,000-$25,000 | 3.25% | $162.50-$812.50 |
| $25,000-$100,000 | 2.50% | $625-$2,500 |
| $100,000-$500,000 | 1.75% | $1,750-$8,750 |
| $500,000-$1,000,000 | 1.25% | $6,250-$12,500 |
| $1,000,000+ | 0.89% | $8,900+ |

**Minimum fee**: $25 (applies to sub-$1,000 transactions, rare for websites).

A **$400,000 content site purchase**:
- Escrow fee: 1.75% = $7,000
- Buyer deposits: $407,000 ($400K purchase + $7K escrow fee)
- Seller receives: $400,000 (after escrow approves release)

**Fee negotiation**: Buyers and sellers agree who pays. **Standard practice**: buyer pays escrow fee (seller receives full purchase price). Some negotiations split the fee 50/50.

A **$200,000 site** with split escrow fee:
- Total escrow fee: 2.50% = $5,000
- Buyer pays: $202,500 ($200K + $2,500)
- Seller receives: $197,500 ($200K - $2,500)

Sellers listing on **Empire Flippers** or **Flippa** typically negotiate **buyer pays escrow** as standard. Sellers in direct deals (no broker) sometimes split fees to sweeten terms.

## Asset Transfer Checklist

**Comprehensive asset list** defined in escrow instructions:

**Domain Assets**:
- Domain name (transfer via registrar authorization code)
- DNS records (A records, CNAME, MX records for email)
- SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt auto-renews, paid certs transfer)

**Hosting Assets**:
- Website files (WordPress, HTML, databases)
- Hosting account credentials (cPanel, WP Engine, Kinsta)
- Email accounts (if hosted on domain)

**Analytics Assets**:
- Google Analytics (UA or GA4 property ownership transfer)
- Google Search Console (property ownership transfer)
- Google Tag Manager (container ownership transfer)

**Monetization Assets**:
- Ad network accounts (Mediavine, AdThrive, Ezoic ownership transfer)
- Affiliate accounts (ShareASale, CJ Affiliate, Impact—contact affiliate manager for transfer)
- Amazon Associates (buyer applies fresh, links updated post-transfer)

**Marketing Assets**:
- Email list (export CSV or transfer ESP account ownership)
- Social media accounts (Facebook page admin, Twitter account ownership)
- Google Business Profile (if applicable for local businesses)

**Operational Assets**:
- SOPs (standard operating procedures for content, SEO, outreach)
- Content calendar (editorial calendar, keyword research sheets)
- Vendor contacts (writers, VAs, graphic designers)

**Legal Assets**:
- Trademark registrations (if applicable)
- Contracts (writer agreements, VA contracts)
- Privacy policy, terms of service (updated with buyer's entity info)

**Incomplete transfers** trigger escrow disputes. A buyer deposits $500K, receives domain and hosting but **Mediavine account transfer pending for 30 days**. Buyer refuses to approve escrow release until Mediavine confirms new ownership. Escrow holds funds until Mediavine completes transfer.

## Domain Transfer Process

**Domain transfers** take 5-14 days depending on registrar. Steps:

**Day 1-2: Seller preparation**
- Unlock domain at current registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, Cloudflare)
- Obtain authorization code (EPP code, transfer code)
- Disable WHOIS privacy (required for transfer verification)
- Provide auth code to buyer

**Day 3-5: Buyer initiation**
- Buyer initiates transfer at receiving registrar
- Buyer enters authorization code
- Buyer receives email confirmation (verify transfer request)

**Day 6-10: Registrar processing**
- Current registrar emails seller (confirm transfer approval)
- Seller approves transfer (click link in email)
- OR Seller does nothing (auto-approves after 5 days)

**Day 11-14: Transfer completion**
- Domain moves to buyer's registrar
- DNS propagates (24-48 hours, site may be unreachable briefly)
- Buyer updates nameservers if needed

**Transfer failure scenarios**:
- Domain locked (seller forgot to unlock)
- Wrong authorization code (typo in EPP code)
- WHOIS privacy enabled (registrar rejects transfer)
- Domain within 60-day transfer lock period (ICANN rule after registrar change or WHOIS update)

**60-day transfer lock** is common. A seller who updated WHOIS info 30 days before listing must **wait 30 more days** to transfer. This delays escrow release. Sellers mitigate by **updating WHOIS 60+ days before listing** or using **registrars with no lock policy** (Cloudflare allows immediate transfers).

## Ad Network Account Transfers

**Mediavine transfer** (most common for content sites earning $10K+/month):

**Timeline**: 14-21 days
**Process**:
- Seller submits transfer request via Mediavine dashboard
- Buyer receives email invitation to create Mediavine account
- Buyer completes application (site review, traffic verification)
- Mediavine approves buyer (7-14 days)
- Ownership transfers, buyer receives payments going forward

**Revenue gap**: Seller receives **final payment** for traffic generated before transfer date. Buyer receives **first payment** for traffic generated after transfer date. If transfer occurs mid-month, payments split proportionally.

A **$12,000/month Mediavine site** transfers on **March 15**:
- Seller receives March payment for March 1-14 traffic (~$6,000) on April 15
- Buyer receives March payment for March 15-31 traffic (~$6,000) on April 15
- Both parties see revenue continuity

**AdThrive transfer** (faster than Mediavine):

**Timeline**: 7-14 days
**Process**:
- Seller contacts AdThrive account manager (email or dashboard)
- Buyer receives invitation, completes application
- AdThrive approves (5-10 days, faster than Mediavine)
- Ownership transfers

**Revenue handling** identical to Mediavine (pro-rated by transfer date).

**Ezoic transfer** (fastest):

**Timeline**: 3-7 days
**Process**:
- Seller submits transfer via Ezoic dashboard
- Buyer creates Ezoic account, verifies domain ownership (DNS TXT record)
- Transfer completes within 3-7 days

**Google AdSense** (rare for sites $10K+/month, more common for smaller sites):

**Non-transferable**. AdSense accounts are personal. Buyer must:
- Apply for new AdSense account
- Wait for approval (1-14 days)
- Replace ad code on site

**Revenue gap**: 7-30 days with **zero ad revenue** during transition. Buyers negotiate **price reduction** to compensate. A $5K/month AdSense site with 30-day revenue gap negotiates **$5K price reduction** to offset lost income.

## Traffic and Revenue Verification

**Buyer due diligence** during escrow verification phase:

**Traffic verification**:
- Compare Google Analytics (30 days pre-sale vs 30 days post-transfer)
- Check for traffic drops >20% (red flag, investigate cause)
- Verify traffic sources (organic, direct, referral match seller's claims)
- Check for bot traffic (sudden spikes, unusual geographies)

**Revenue verification**:
- Log into ad network dashboard (Mediavine, AdThrive) and verify RPMs match seller's screenshots
- Check affiliate dashboards (ShareASale, CJ) for commission consistency
- Request payment processor statements (PayPal, Stripe) if applicable

**Common verification issues**:

**Traffic drop 30%**: Buyer discovers **Google core update** hit the site 10 days after transfer. Seller claims: "Algorithm update, not my fault." Buyer claims: "Site quality issue, seller misrepresented stability."

**Resolution**: Escrow mediates. If traffic drop is **industry-wide** (other sites in niche also dropped), seller not at fault. If traffic drop is **site-specific** (other sites unaffected), seller misrepresented quality. Buyer negotiates **15-20% price reduction** or cancels deal.

**RPM mismatch**: Seller claimed **$25 RPM**. Buyer verifies **$18 RPM** in ad network dashboard during verification period.

**Resolution**: Seller explains: "RPMs fluctuate seasonally. Screenshots from Q4 (holiday peak), transfer in Q2 (lower RPMs)." Buyer accepts explanation or negotiates price adjustment based on actual RPM.

**Affiliate account issue**: Seller transferred **ShareASale affiliate account** but commissions pending for 60 days (advertiser payment terms). Buyer receives $0 revenue for 60 days post-transfer.

**Resolution**: Buyer knew terms upfront (disclosed in listing), no recourse. OR Seller failed to disclose 60-day payment terms, buyer claims misrepresentation, negotiates **$10K holdback** from escrow (released after buyer receives first commission payment).

[Evaluate Amazon affiliate site](evaluate-amazon-affiliate-site.html) provides **due diligence checklists** buyers use to verify site quality and revenue claims during escrow.

## Dispute Resolution

**Escrow disputes** occur in 10-15% of transactions. Common triggers:
- Traffic decline >25% during verification
- Missing assets (affiliate accounts not transferred)
- Revenue misrepresentation (RPMs lower than claimed)
- Technical issues (site broken after migration)

**Escrow.com dispute process**:

**Step 1: Buyer files dispute** (via Escrow.com dashboard)
- Buyer submits evidence (screenshots, analytics, broken links)
- Escrow notifies seller, requests response (48-hour deadline)

**Step 2: Seller responds**
- Seller provides counter-evidence (algorithm update data, migration logs)
- Seller proposes resolution (price reduction, extended support, fix issues)

**Step 3: Negotiation** (7-14 days)
- Buyer and seller negotiate via Escrow.com messaging
- Common outcomes: 10-30% price reduction, extended seller support, partial refund

**Step 4: Mediation** (if negotiation fails)
- Escrow.com assigns mediator (neutral third party)
- Mediator reviews evidence (traffic data, contracts, communications)
- Mediator issues binding decision (release funds, refund buyer, split difference)

**Mediation cost**: $500-$2,000 (split between parties or assigned to losing party).

**Example dispute**:

A **$300K health site** shows **35% traffic drop** during verification. Buyer files dispute. Seller claims **Google helpful content update** (algorithm change). Buyer claims **thin content** (site quality issue).

**Mediation review**: Mediator analyzes:
- Google Search Console (manual actions? No)
- Ahrefs backlink profile (toxic links? No)
- Industry benchmarks (other health sites dropped 20-30% same period? Yes)

**Decision**: Algorithm update, not seller fault. **Traffic drop industry-wide**. Buyer's claim rejected. **Escrow releases $300K to seller**. Buyer pays $1,000 mediation fee.

**Buyer lesson**: Due diligence includes checking **algorithm update schedules** (Google announces core updates months before). Buyer assumed site-specific issue without verifying industry trends.

[Empire Flippers review sellers](empire-flippers-review-sellers.html) explains how **Empire Flippers brokers mediate disputes** before they escalate to Escrow.com formal mediation.

## Seller Support Period

**30-day seller support** is standard in escrow agreements. Seller provides:
- Email/phone support (respond within 24-48 hours)
- Training materials (SOPs, video walkthroughs)
- Troubleshooting (fix broken redirects, restore backups if needed)

**Extended support** (60-90 days) negotiated for:
- Complex sites (custom code, integrations)
- YMYL sites (health, finance requiring author transitions)
- First-time buyers (need hand-holding)

**Seller responsibilities** during support period:
- Answer buyer questions (content strategy, SEO tactics, monetization)
- Provide missing documentation (writer contacts, affiliate terms)
- Fix migration issues (DNS problems, broken links)

**Seller limitations**:
- Not required to create new content (buyer's responsibility)
- Not required to fix buyer errors (buyer accidentally deletes pages, seller not liable)
- Not required to guarantee revenue (algorithm changes, buyer operational mistakes)

A **buyer breaks the site** by installing a bad plugin 20 days post-transfer. Buyer requests seller fix it. Seller declines (buyer caused issue). Escrow agrees with seller. Buyer pays developer $500 to fix self-inflicted problem.

A **seller misconfigured DNS** during transfer, causing 3 days downtime. Buyer lost **$1,200 revenue** (3 days × $400/day). Buyer requests seller compensate. Escrow mediates: seller caused issue, owes compensation. **$1,200 deducted from escrow payout to seller**, sent to buyer.

**Clear support boundaries** in escrow agreements prevent disputes. Well-drafted agreements specify:
- Seller responds within 24 hours (not 1 hour, not 7 days)
- Seller fixes migration issues caused by seller (not buyer errors)
- Seller provides documentation (not ongoing consulting)

## International Transactions

**Cross-border sales** (U.S. seller to international buyer, or vice versa) add complexity:

**Currency**: Escrow.com supports USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, CAD. Transactions in other currencies convert to USD (seller receives USD equivalent).

**Wire transfer fees**: International wires cost $25-$50 (buyer pays). Seller receives net proceeds minus wire fees.

**Tax withholding**: U.S. sellers selling to international buyers may face **30% withholding tax** unless buyer's country has tax treaty with U.S. (most developed countries do). Buyers submit **W-8BEN form** (foreign person exemption) to avoid withholding.

**Example**: **Canadian buyer** acquires **U.S. seller's site** for $500K. Canada-U.S. tax treaty exempts withholding. Buyer submits W-8BEN. Seller receives full $500K (minus escrow fee).

**Non-treaty countries** (China, Russia, Brazil in some cases): **30% withholding** = $150K on a $500K sale. Seller nets **$350K**. Buyers from non-treaty countries negotiate **price reduction** to offset withholding.

**Domain transfer restrictions**: Some country-code TLDs (ccTLDs) restrict ownership by geography. A **.uk domain** requires U.K. presence. A **U.S. buyer** acquiring a .uk domain must use **domain trustee service** (third party holds domain on buyer's behalf, $50-$200/year).

## Escrow for Seller Financing

**Seller financing** (buyer pays over 12-36 months) uses escrow differently:

**Structure**:
- Buyer pays down payment (30-50%) into escrow
- Escrow releases down payment to seller after asset transfer
- Buyer makes monthly payments directly to seller (or via payment processor)
- Domain held in escrow until final payment (collateral protection for seller)

**Example**: $400K site with seller financing:
- Buyer pays **$160K down** (40%) into escrow
- Seller transfers hosting, ad accounts, analytics (keeps domain)
- Escrow releases $160K to seller after verification
- Buyer pays **$10K/month for 24 months** (remaining $240K)
- After 24 months, domain transfers from escrow to buyer

**Default scenario**: Buyer misses payments after 12 months ($120K paid, $120K remaining). **Escrow returns domain to seller**. Seller keeps **$280K** ($160K down + $120K monthly payments) and reclaims site. Buyer loses $280K and the site.

**Seller protection**: Domain held in escrow prevents buyer from running the site into the ground then defaulting. Seller reclaims asset with value intact.

**Buyer protection**: Escrow prevents seller from keeping domain after buyer completes payments. Automated release after final payment.

**Seller financing escrow cost**: $500-$2,000 annual holding fee (Escrow.com charges to hold domain long-term).

[FE International review](fe-international-review.html) explains how **M&A brokers structure seller financing terms** and escrow arrangements for deals $500K-$10M+.

## Escrow Alternatives

**PayPal** (used for <$50K transactions):
- **Buyer protection**: 180-day dispute window
- **Seller risk**: PayPal sides with buyers 70-80% of disputes
- **Fee**: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction ($1,450 on $50K)

**Stripe** (rare for websites, common for SaaS):
- **Buyer protection**: 120-day chargeback window
- **Seller risk**: Chargebacks favor buyers
- **Fee**: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction

**Cryptocurrency escrow** (Bitcoin, Ethereum via smart contracts):
- **Pros**: Low fees (0.1-0.5%), fast settlement (hours vs days)
- **Cons**: Volatility risk, limited dispute resolution, niche buyer pool
- **Usage**: <5% of website transactions

**Direct transfer** (no escrow):
- **Pros**: Zero fees
- **Cons**: 100% counterparty risk (fraud, non-payment, non-delivery)
- **Usage**: Only between trusted parties (friends, repeat buyers, established relationships)

**Recommendation**: Use **Escrow.com for all transactions $50K+**. The 1-3% fee ($500-$30,000) prevents **100% loss risk** ($50K-$10M+). PayPal acceptable for $10K-$50K if buyer has strong reputation. Never use direct transfer unless you personally know and trust the counterparty.

[Flippa vs Empire Flippers vs Motion Invest](flippa-vs-empire-flippers-vs-motion-invest.html) documents which **marketplaces require escrow** vs allow PayPal or direct payment.

## Conclusion

**Escrow services** protect buyers and sellers in website transactions by:
1. Holding funds until asset transfer completes ($50K-$10M+ held safely)
2. Defining clear transfer requirements (asset checklist, verification timelines)
3. Mediating disputes (traffic drops, revenue mismatches, technical issues)
4. Ensuring domain security (domain held until payment completes in seller financing)

**Escrow.com fee structure** (0.89-3.25%) costs **$2,670-$97,500** on $300K-$3M transactions but prevents **$300K-$3M loss risk**. The insurance value justifies the fee.

**Standard escrow timeline**: 30-60 days (asset transfer 8-35 days, verification 14-30 days, release 3-7 days). Complex sites (ad network transfers, affiliate account migrations) take 60-90 days. Simple sites (domain + hosting only) close in 30 days.

**Dispute rate**: 10-15% of transactions. Most disputes resolve via negotiation (price reductions, extended support). Formal mediation occurs in 2-3% of cases. Mediation costs $500-$2,000 but prevents deal collapse and total loss.

Buyers and sellers using escrow reduce fraud risk to **near-zero**. The 1-3% fee is **counterparty risk insurance**. Transactions without escrow carry **10-30% fraud risk** depending on buyer/seller reputation and transaction size.

## FAQ

**How much does escrow cost for a $200,000 website purchase?**
2.50% = $5,000. Buyer typically pays the fee, depositing $205,000 total. Seller receives $200,000 after escrow approves release. Fee negotiable (sometimes split 50/50, so $2,500 each).

**How long does escrow take for a website sale?**
30-60 days on average. Domain transfer 5-14 days, ad network account transfer 7-21 days, buyer verification 14-30 days, fund release 3-7 days. Complex sites (multiple ad networks, large email lists) take 60-90 days.

**What happens if the buyer refuses to approve escrow release?**
Seller files dispute with Escrow.com. If buyer's reason is invalid (e.g., traffic normal but buyer claims drop), escrow mediates and forces release. If buyer's reason is valid (e.g., assets missing, revenue misrepresented), escrow holds funds until resolved or issues partial refund.

**Can I use PayPal instead of Escrow.com?**
Yes, for transactions under $50K. PayPal offers buyer protection (180-day dispute window) but sides with buyers 70-80% of the time, creating seller risk. Escrow.com recommended for all sales $50K+ due to neutral mediation and stronger seller protection.

**What assets are held in escrow during seller financing?**
Domain name only. Seller transfers hosting, ad accounts, and analytics to buyer immediately (buyer needs these to operate the site). Domain held in escrow as collateral—releases to buyer after final payment. If buyer defaults, domain returns to seller and buyer loses all payments made.
