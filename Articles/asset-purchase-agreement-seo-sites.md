# Asset Purchase Agreements for SEO Websites — What to Include

**Asset purchase agreements** govern website acquisitions and determine whether you own what you think you're buying. Unlike stock purchases where you acquire the entity itself, asset purchases transfer specific assets: domain name, content library, social profiles, email lists, hosting accounts, and intellectual property. The difference matters because websites bundle multiple asset classes across fragmented ownership — the domain registers at **GoDaddy**, content lives on **WordPress**, email list sits in **ConvertKit**, and social accounts link to personal seller credentials. An incomplete agreement leaves you holding a domain while the seller retains the email list, social accounts, and content rights. The spread between a clean acquisition and a fragmented mess comes down to contract specificity.

Sophisticated buyers use asset purchase agreements to shift risk from buyer to seller. Standard marketplace transactions (Flippa, Empire Flippers) use templated agreements that protect the marketplace, not the buyer. Custom agreements specify exactly what transfers, what warranties the seller provides, what happens if traffic collapses post-sale, and how disputes resolve. The agreement creates the boundary between a $50,000 asset and a $50,000 lawsuit. Operators who treat agreements as boilerplate discover they bought a domain pointing to empty server space while the seller retained content licenses and walked with the email database.

## Core Asset Classes in Website Acquisitions

Website transactions involve multiple asset categories that must be enumerated individually in the purchase agreement.

### Digital Assets Requiring Explicit Transfer Language

**Domain name and DNS records:**
- Domain registration transfer to buyer's registrar account
- DNS zone file export and configuration transfer
- Historical WHOIS privacy settings disclosure
- Transfer authorization codes and unlock instructions
- All subdomains and wildcard configurations

**Content and intellectual property:**
- Copyright assignment for all published articles, images, graphics
- Database export containing all posts, pages, comments
- Media library (images, PDFs, videos) with usage rights verification
- Unpublished draft content in staging environments
- Editorial calendar and planned content pipeline
- Trademark rights if site operates as branded entity

**Technical infrastructure:**
- Hosting account credentials and access transfer
- CMS installation files and database backups
- Theme and plugin licenses (transferable vs. non-transferable)
- SSL certificates and security credentials
- API keys for integrated services
- CDN configurations and caching rules
- Email server settings and mailbox data

**Revenue assets:**
- Ad network accounts (AdSense, Mediavine, AdThrive)
- Affiliate program memberships and tracking links
- Sponsored content relationships and contact lists
- Product partnerships with existing commission agreements
- Email list with explicit subscriber consent documentation

**Marketing and distribution:**
- Social media account transfers (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest)
- Email marketing platform account and subscriber database
- YouTube channel ownership transfer
- Podcast RSS feed and hosting credentials
- Newsletter subscriber lists with opt-in verification

**Analytics and tracking:**
- Google Analytics property transfer
- Google Search Console site verification and ownership
- Rank tracking tool accounts and historical data
- Heatmap and user session recording archives
- Conversion tracking configurations

Missing any category creates post-acquisition operational gaps. The [escrow website purchases guide](/articles/escrow-website-purchases.html) covers how to structure payment releases around successful asset transfers.

## Essential Contract Clauses and Protective Language

Standard agreements contain generic language. Protective agreements anticipate failure modes and assign liability explicitly.

### Representations and Warranties Section

**Traffic and revenue representations:**
- Seller represents that all traffic data disclosed during due diligence is accurate and complete
- Revenue figures are verified through third-party reporting dashboards (Google Analytics, ad networks)
- No material adverse changes occurred between listing date and closing date
- No traffic or revenue originated from paid advertising, traffic exchanges, or bot networks
- All traffic sources are organic, direct, referral, or social from legitimate users
- No pending algorithm updates or ranking penalties known to seller at time of sale

**Content ownership and legality:**
- Seller owns 100% copyright to all content or has transferable licenses
- No content infringes third-party intellectual property rights
- No content violates platform terms of service (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- All images are original, licensed, or public domain with proper attribution
- No plagiarism or AI-generated content misrepresented as original (if relevant to buyer)
- All affiliate disclosures and legal disclaimers comply with FTC requirements

**Link profile and SEO representations:**
- No PBN links or manipulative link schemes employed
- All backlinks acquired through white-hat methods
- No paid link placements in violation of Google Webmaster Guidelines
- Link profile disclosed during due diligence is complete and accurate
- No disavow files or manual actions in Google Search Console
- No history of Google penalties (manual or algorithmic) in past 24 months

**Financial and operational representations:**
- All expenses disclosed (hosting, content, tools, contractors)
- No hidden liabilities or unpaid invoices
- All tax obligations satisfied through closing date
- No outstanding disputes with customers, partners, or vendors
- All contracts with third parties disclosed and assignable (or terminable without penalty)

### Indemnification Provisions

Indemnification shifts risk of pre-sale issues to seller post-closing.

**Standard indemnification clause template:**

"Seller agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) arising from:
- Breach of any representation or warranty contained in this agreement
- Intellectual property infringement claims related to content published prior to closing date
- Tax liabilities or government penalties for periods prior to closing date
- Violations of platform terms of service resulting in account suspension or termination
- Undisclosed liabilities or obligations incurred prior to closing date"

**Indemnification cap:** Set indemnification liability at 100% of purchase price for 12-24 months post-closing. Example: $75,000 purchase price = $75,000 maximum indemnification liability through month 24.

**Survival period:** Representations and warranties survive closing for 12-24 months. Beyond that period, seller has no liability (except for fraud or willful misrepresentation, which survive indefinitely).

**Claims process:** Buyer must notify seller of indemnification claims within 30 days of discovery. Seller has 60 days to cure the breach or compensate buyer. If seller fails to cure, buyer can pursue legal remedies and offset indemnification amounts against any remaining payment obligations (if deal structured with earnout or seller financing).

### Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation Clauses

Sellers who exit but immediately rebuild competing sites erode buyer value.

**Standard non-compete language:**

"For 24 months following closing, Seller agrees not to:
- Create, operate, or have ownership interest in websites targeting the same niche (define niche specifically: 'personal finance content targeting US consumers' vs. vague 'finance websites')
- Publish content on topics covered by the acquired site that competes for same search terms or audience
- Solicit or accept sponsored content or affiliate partnerships in the same vertical using personal brand or new properties
- Redirect traffic from personal social media accounts or email lists to competing properties"

**Geographic and scope limitations:** Courts strike down overly broad non-competes. Narrow the restriction to specific niche, geography (if site targets specific country/region), and content topics. "Seller will not create health and wellness websites" is too broad. "Seller will not create websites focused on ketogenic diet content for US consumers" is enforceable.

**Non-solicitation of business relationships:**

"For 12 months following closing, Seller agrees not to:
- Solicit or accept business from sponsored content advertisers who worked with the site in 12 months prior to closing
- Recruit or hire contractors (writers, designers, VAs) who worked on the site within 6 months prior to closing
- Interfere with affiliate partnerships, ad network relationships, or content distribution agreements transferred to buyer"

**Enforcement mechanism:** Include liquidated damages clause. "In the event Seller breaches non-compete provisions, Seller agrees to pay Buyer $X per month of violation" (set X at 50-100% of monthly revenue at time of sale). This gives you remedy without expensive litigation.

The [non-compete clauses website sales guide](/articles/non-compete-clauses-website-sales.html) covers state-by-state enforceability variations and drafting strategies.

## Transfer Mechanics and Closing Conditions

Asset transfers fail when agreements lack step-by-step execution instructions.

### Sequenced Transfer Checklist

Proper sequencing prevents seller from retaining access after receiving payment.

**Day -7 (pre-closing):**
- Buyer deposits funds in escrow
- Seller provides export files for content, database, media library
- Buyer confirms files are complete and importable
- Both parties confirm readiness to execute transfer

**Day 0 (closing day):**
- Morning: Seller initiates domain transfer, provides auth code
- Seller transfers hosting account ownership or provides full admin credentials
- Seller transfers Google Analytics property to buyer's email
- Seller adds buyer as owner in Google Search Console and removes self
- Seller transfers social media account ownership (email change, admin transfer)
- Seller initiates email marketing platform account transfer
- Afternoon: Buyer confirms receipt and access to all assets
- Escrow releases funds to seller upon buyer confirmation

**Day +1 to +7 (post-closing):**
- Buyer changes all passwords and removes seller admin access
- Buyer confirms domain DNS propagation and site functionality
- Buyer verifies analytics tracking is functional
- Buyer confirms email deliverability and subscriber list integrity
- Seller completes ad network and affiliate account ownership transfers (these often require 7-14 days for platform approval)

**Transfer failure conditions:**
- If any asset transfer fails or is incomplete, escrow withholds proportional payment amount
- Example: Domain and content transfer successfully, but seller fails to transfer social media accounts with 100K followers. Escrow withholds 20% of payment ($15,000 on $75,000 deal) until seller completes social transfer or compensates buyer for lost asset value.

### Earnout and Deferred Payment Structures

Earnouts protect buyers from traffic or revenue collapse post-sale.

**Standard earnout structure:**

- **Upfront payment:** 60-70% of purchase price at closing
- **Earnout period:** 6-12 months
- **Earnout trigger:** Site maintains 80%+ of baseline traffic or revenue during earnout period
- **Payment schedule:** Monthly or quarterly earnout payments based on performance

**Example earnout deal:**

$100,000 purchase price structured as:
- $65,000 at closing
- $35,000 earnout over 12 months, paid monthly at $2,917/month
- Earnout condition: Site maintains minimum 8,000 monthly visitors (baseline: 10,000)
- If traffic drops below 8,000 in any month, earnout payment for that month is withheld
- If traffic remains below threshold for 3+ consecutive months, remaining earnout is forfeit

**Earnout disputes:**

Define measurement methodology precisely to avoid disputes:
- Traffic measured via Google Analytics (specify which view, what date range, whether to exclude bot traffic)
- Revenue measured via ad network reports, affiliate dashboard screenshots, or bank deposits
- Who has access to measurement accounts (both parties should have read-only access)
- Dispute resolution: If parties disagree on whether earnout condition is met, third-party auditor reviews data and makes binding determination (each party pays half the audit cost)

**Earnout advantages for buyers:**
- Reduces risk of paying full price for site that collapses post-acquisition
- Keeps seller motivated to ensure smooth transition (they want to collect earnout)
- Aligns incentives during critical transition period

**Earnout disadvantages:**
- Seller retains some control (may demand input on major site changes during earnout period)
- Creates ongoing relationship and potential disputes
- Delays full ownership transfer emotionally and financially

## Risk Allocation and Liability Caps

Unlimited liability creates exposure. Negotiated caps define maximum downside.

### Purchase Price Escrow Holdback

Hold back 10-20% of purchase price in escrow for 90-180 days post-closing to cover undisclosed issues.

**Escrow holdback structure:**

$80,000 purchase price:
- $64,000 released to seller at closing
- $16,000 held in escrow for 120 days
- If no claims arise during holdback period, funds release to seller automatically
- If issues arise (traffic decline, penalty disclosure, link profile contamination), buyer can file claim against holdback

**Claimable issues:**

- **Material misrepresentation:** Seller claimed 50,000 monthly visitors, actual is 35,000 (supported by Google Analytics)
- **Undisclosed liabilities:** Hosting bill is $300/month, seller represented $60/month
- **Penalty or algorithmic suppression:** Site receives manual action from Google in first 60 days post-closing that originated from pre-sale issues (PBN links, spam tactics)
- **Content ownership issues:** DMCA takedown notice proves seller published plagiarized content

Escrow agent (Escrow.com, Dan.com, or attorney trust account) releases funds based on evidence from both parties. If dispute is unresolved, escrow funds remain frozen until arbitration or court judgment.

### Limitation of Liability Provisions

Cap maximum liability to prevent single acquisition from bankrupting either party.

**Standard liability cap language:**

"Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, the maximum aggregate liability of Seller to Buyer for any and all claims arising from this agreement shall not exceed the total purchase price paid by Buyer."

Translation: If buyer paid $60,000, maximum recovery from seller is $60,000 even if damages exceed that amount.

**Carveouts from liability cap:**

Unlimited liability for:
- Fraud or intentional misrepresentation
- Criminal activity (stolen content, pirated software licenses, tax evasion)
- Gross negligence

Standard breach of representations has capped liability. Intentional fraud has unlimited liability.

### Asset Condition "As-Is" vs. Performance Warranties

Two competing philosophies govern website sales.

**"As-is" sales:**
- Buyer accepts site in current condition with no warranties
- Seller disclaims all guarantees about future performance
- Buyer bears full risk of post-acquisition traffic loss or operational issues
- Typical language: "Site is sold AS-IS, WHERE-IS, with no representations or warranties regarding future performance, traffic, or revenue."

**Performance warranty sales:**
- Seller warrants site will maintain minimum performance thresholds
- If site underperforms, seller provides refund, remediation, or compensation
- Typical language: "Seller warrants that site will maintain 80% of baseline traffic for 90 days post-closing. If traffic falls below threshold due to issues originating pre-sale, Seller will compensate Buyer for lost revenue or provide partial refund."

**Operator perspective:** Negotiate performance warranties on first few acquisitions to limit downside risk. As experience grows, accept "as-is" terms in exchange for purchase price discounts (sellers discount 10-15% for as-is deals because they eliminate post-sale liability).

The [website acquisition due diligence checklist guide](/articles/website-acquisition-due-diligence-checklist.html) covers verification steps that reduce reliance on seller warranties.

## Dispute Resolution and Governing Law

Lawsuits cost more than most website acquisitions. Arbitration clauses prevent expensive litigation.

### Mandatory Arbitration Provisions

**Standard arbitration clause:**

"Any dispute arising from this agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall take place in [specify location or virtual]. Each party shall bear its own legal fees, and the parties shall split arbitrator fees equally. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding, and judgment may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction."

**Why arbitration beats litigation:**
- **Speed:** Arbitration resolves in 3-6 months vs. 18-36 months for litigation
- **Cost:** Arbitration costs $5,000-15,000 total vs. $50,000-200,000+ for trial
- **Expertise:** Choose arbitrator with digital asset transaction experience (courts assign random judges unfamiliar with SEO, backlinks, and algorithm updates)
- **Privacy:** Arbitration is confidential; litigation creates public records that damage reputations

**Optional: Mediation before arbitration:**

Add staged dispute resolution: "Parties agree to first attempt resolution through informal negotiation (30 days), then formal mediation (30 days), then binding arbitration if mediation fails."

Mediation costs $2,000-5,000 and resolves 60-70% of disputes before arbitration. Saves both parties money and time.

### Choice of Law and Venue

**Standard choice of law clause:**

"This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [Delaware / California / New York], without regard to its conflicts of law principles."

**Why Delaware:** Pro-business laws, developed contract case law, and specialized chancery court familiar with asset transactions. Used by sophisticated operators.

**Why seller's home state:** If seller is individual in Texas, Texas law governs. Reduces seller resistance to signing.

**Why neutral state:** If buyer is in California and seller is in Florida, choose neutral state like New York to avoid home-court advantage.

**Jurisdiction clause (if not using arbitration):**

"Parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction of state and federal courts located in [county, state] for any disputes arising from this agreement."

Without jurisdiction clause, seller could force buyer to litigate in seller's home jurisdiction, adding travel costs and inconvenience.

## Transition Support and Post-Sale Assistance

Asset transfer isn't complete when funds exchange. Transition support clauses ensure operational continuity.

### Seller Transition Obligations

**Standard transition support term:**

"For 30 days following closing, Seller agrees to provide reasonable assistance to Buyer to facilitate operational transition, including:
- Responding to buyer questions about site operations, content workflow, and vendor relationships
- Introducing Buyer to key contractors (writers, VA, designer)
- Providing passwords, credentials, and access to accounts not transferred at closing
- Assisting with ad network account ownership transfers (which require 7-14 days)
- One 60-minute transition call within 7 days of closing to review site operations"

**Compensation for transition support:** Included in purchase price (no additional payment). If buyer requires extensive support beyond 30 days, negotiate hourly consulting rate ($75-150/hour) for additional assistance.

**Transition support failure remedy:** If seller becomes unresponsive post-closing and fails to provide agreed support, buyer can file claim against escrow holdback (if one exists) or pursue breach of contract claim.

### Operational Handoff Documentation

Require seller to provide written documentation covering:

**Content operations:**
- Editorial calendar and publication schedule
- Writer contact information and rates
- Content briefs and style guide
- Image sourcing process (stock photo accounts, design tools)
- SEO optimization checklist used for articles

**Technical operations:**
- Hosting provider and plan details
- Theme and plugin list with version numbers
- Backup and security protocols
- Uptime monitoring setup
- CDN configuration and purging procedures

**Revenue operations:**
- Ad network payment schedules and thresholds
- Affiliate program application status and commission rates
- Sponsored content pricing and advertiser contact list
- Email monetization strategy and send frequency

**Marketing and distribution:**
- Social media posting schedule and tools used
- Email marketing automation sequences
- Guest posting and backlink outreach templates
- Promotion channels and communities (Reddit, forums, Facebook groups)

Document delivery: Seller provides these materials at closing as condition of escrow release.

The [transition website after purchase guide](/articles/transition-website-after-purchase.html) covers execution steps for smooth operational handoff.

## Sample Contract Sections and Templates

These are starting points, not legal advice. Customize with attorney review.

### Domain Transfer Language Template

"Seller agrees to transfer full ownership and control of the domain name [domain.com] registered at [registrar name] to Buyer's registrar account. Seller will:
1. Unlock the domain and disable privacy protection within 24 hours of closing
2. Provide domain authorization code to Buyer
3. Approve transfer request initiated by Buyer within 24 hours of receipt
4. Buyer will reimburse Seller for any remaining registration period value (prorated monthly)
5. Transfer shall be completed within 7 days of closing, or escrow will withhold $[X amount] until transfer completes"

### Content and IP Assignment Template

"Seller hereby assigns, transfers, and conveys to Buyer all right, title, and interest in and to:
- All content published on [domain.com], including articles, blog posts, images, videos, infographics, and downloadable resources
- All unpublished content, drafts, outlines, and editorial materials
- All copyrights, trademarks, trade names, and intellectual property rights associated with the site
- Seller warrants that all content is original or properly licensed, and that Seller has authority to transfer all rights
- Seller agrees to execute any additional documents necessary to perfect Buyer's ownership rights"

### Earnout Performance Metrics Template

"Earnout payments totaling $[X] shall be paid monthly over [Y] months contingent on the site maintaining the following performance benchmarks:
- Minimum monthly organic traffic: [X visitors] (measured via Google Analytics property ID [####], using [specify view name], excluding bot traffic per GA bot filtering)
- Minimum monthly revenue: $[X] (measured via [ad network dashboard name] and [affiliate network name] verified reports)
- Earnout payments shall be made within 10 days of month-end upon Buyer's verification that benchmarks were met
- If benchmarks are not met in any given month, the earnout payment for that month is forfeited and not recoverable in future months
- Both parties shall have read-only access to all measurement accounts to verify performance independently"

## FAQ

### What's the minimum contract complexity needed for small website acquisitions under $10,000?

Even sub-$10,000 acquisitions should include: (1) Asset list specifying what transfers, (2) Seller representation that traffic/revenue data is accurate, (3) Content ownership warranty, (4) Non-compete clause (12 months minimum), (5) Dispute resolution method (arbitration preferred). You can use simplified 3-4 page agreement for smaller deals, but never skip these core protections. Marketplace templates (**Flippa**, **Motion Invest**) provide baseline language but add custom clauses for IP assignment and non-compete. Spending $500-1,000 for attorney review on a $7,500 acquisition prevents $20,000 problem when seller rebuilds competing site 6 months later.

### Should buyers require seller to stay on as consultant post-acquisition?

Only if site operations require seller-specific expertise (complex technical setup, proprietary content creation process, exclusive vendor relationships). Standard content sites don't require seller involvement post-transfer. In fact, clean breaks are preferable — seller moves on, buyer takes full control. If you do require consulting, structure it as optional paid arrangement ($1,000-2,000/month for 3-6 months) rather than mandatory obligation. Mandatory consulting creates resentment and poor service. Paid consulting attracts motivated sellers who actually help.

### How do you enforce non-compete clauses when sellers operate anonymously or internationally?

Non-competes are difficult to enforce against anonymous sellers or those in non-US jurisdictions. Mitigation strategies: (1) Require verified seller identity during due diligence (government ID, video verification), (2) Escrow holdback of 15-20% for 12 months (gives you leverage if seller violates), (3) Liquidated damages clause with specific dollar penalties, (4) Purchase agreement includes seller's verified personal/business address and governing law in your jurisdiction. International sellers: Negotiate "no enforcement needed" price (discount the purchase price 20-30% in exchange for eliminating non-compete, since you assume seller may compete). Reality: Non-competes deter casual competition but won't stop determined sellers. Focus due diligence on acquiring sites with strong brand moats that are difficult for sellers to replicate.

### What's the typical survival period for representations and warranties?

12-24 months is standard for website acquisitions. Traffic and revenue warranties survive 90-180 days (short window because performance can change quickly due to algorithm updates and market shifts). Content ownership and IP warranties survive 18-24 months (longer because infringement claims take time to surface). Tax liabilities survive per statutory period (3-7 years depending on jurisdiction). Fraud and intentional misrepresentation survive indefinitely. Negotiate longer survival periods for larger acquisitions ($100K+) and shorter periods for smaller deals where extended liability exposure isn't worth the risk of claims.

### Can you back out of a deal after signing if you discover undisclosed issues?

Depends on agreement structure. **Pre-closing due diligence period:** If agreement includes "due diligence contingency" (buyer has 14-30 days to complete investigation and can withdraw for any reason), yes, you can walk away and get deposit back. **Post-closing discovery:** If you've already closed and discover material misrepresentation (seller lied about traffic, revenue, or content ownership), you have breach of contract claim and can pursue damages, refund, or rescission through arbitration. But burden is on you to prove misrepresentation and that you reasonably relied on false information. This is why thorough pre-closing due diligence is critical — confirm everything seller claims before funds transfer. The [website acquisition due diligence checklist](/articles/website-acquisition-due-diligence-checklist.html) covers verification methods that prevent post-closing surprises.
