# FE International Review: Brokerage Analysis for Six-Figure Website Exits

**FE International** occupies the upper tier of website and SaaS brokerage, specializing in deals between $100,000 and $50 million. For operators building portfolios toward exit, FE represents the institutional off-ramp—rigorous valuation, qualified buyer networks, and transaction structures that survive legal scrutiny.

This review dissects FE's sell-side process from listing through close, identifying where their premium commission structure (10-15%) delivers value and where self-listing on **Flippa** or **Motion Invest** might preserve more proceeds.

## FE International's Valuation Methodology: Anchoring for Negotiation

FE assigns analysts to build valuation models based on trailing twelve months (TTM) earnings, applying industry-specific multiples that range from 2.5x to 5x SDE (seller's discretionary earnings) for content sites, and 3x to 7x for SaaS businesses with recurring revenue.

**Content sites:** FE's analysts discount earnings from ad networks like **Ezoic** or **Mediavine** by 10-15% to account for buyer ramp time and potential traffic volatility post-acquisition. They scrutinize traffic sources, penalizing sites dependent on a single keyword cluster or those exhibiting recent ranking instability. For insights on what buyers examine in traffic data, see [google-analytics-audit-for-buyers.html](google-analytics-audit-for-buyers.html).

**SaaS businesses:** FE favors recurring revenue models with low churn (<5% monthly). They'll push for 4-6x multiples on businesses with annual contracts and negative churn (expansion revenue exceeds cancellations). Month-to-month subscription models get compressed to 3-4x unless you demonstrate strong cohort retention beyond 18 months.

**Valuation anchoring risk:** FE's initial valuation becomes the negotiation anchor for all subsequent buyer discussions. If their analyst undervalues your asset—common when they misinterpret seasonal traffic patterns or discount emerging revenue streams—you'll fight uphill to justify higher multiples. Counter this by preparing your own valuation with comparables from closed FE listings (available in their blog case studies) before accepting representation.

## Fee Structure: When 10-15% Commission Justifies Itself

FE charges 10-15% of transaction value, scaled inversely with deal size (larger deals command lower percentages). For a $500,000 content site sale, expect $50,000-$75,000 in brokerage fees.

This premium pays for:

**Buyer vetting:** FE pre-qualifies buyers with proof of funds and investment theses. You won't waste months negotiating with tire-kickers who evaporate during due diligence. For six-figure exits, this vetting eliminates 80% of the time-wasting that plagues **Flippa** listings. Compare this to the self-service model in [flippa-review-buyers-2026.html](flippa-review-buyers-2026.html).

**Transaction management:** FE coordinates LOIs (letters of intent), due diligence data rooms, escrow setup, and asset transfer logistics. Their team navigates purchase agreement redlines and handles buyer objections that would otherwise derail deals. If you lack legal or M&A experience, this hand-holding prevents deal collapse.

**Confidentiality:** FE listings remain private until buyer NDAs execute. If you're exiting a site while still operating it (common for portfolio operators seeking liquidity without full shutdown), FE's confidentiality prevents competitors or employees from discovering the sale prematurely.

**When FE's fees *don't* justify:**

- Sites under $100K asking price: FE's minimum deal size is effectively $100K, and their attention to sub-$200K deals is inconsistent. Motion Invest or **Empire Flippers** deliver better service-to-fee ratios for sub-six-figure exits.
- Commodity content sites: If you're selling a generic affiliate blog with AdSense monetization and no defensible moat, FE's premium service won't materially increase sale price. Buyers for these assets shop on price, not brokerage pedigree.
- Operator-reliant businesses: If the business requires your ongoing involvement post-sale (consulting, content creation, relationship management), FE struggles to close deals. Their buyers expect turnkey assets.

## FE's Buyer Network: Who's Acquiring Through FE?

FE's buyer roster skews toward:

**Private equity roll-ups:** Firms aggregating content sites into vertical-specific portfolios (health, finance, home services). These buyers pay premium multiples (4.5-5x) but demand immaculate due diligence documentation and may require earnouts tied to post-sale performance.

**Individual operators with institutional backing:** Solo entrepreneurs who've raised search funds or small private equity to acquire and operate cash-flowing websites. These buyers move faster than PE roll-ups but expect seller financing (10-20% of purchase price, 2-3 year note).

**SaaS aggregators:** For software businesses, FE connects with consolidators like Tiny, Verne, and micro-PE funds focused on niche B2B SaaS. These buyers prioritize MRR (monthly recurring revenue) stability over growth rate and tolerate churn up to 7% if customer acquisition cost economics are strong.

**International buyers:** FE's global reach attracts EU and APAC buyers seeking US/UK traffic assets. Currency exchange dynamics can work in your favor if you're willing to accept EUR or GBP proceeds.

**Who's *not* buying through FE:** Speculative flippers, first-time buyers without operating experience, and buyers seeking "fixer-upper" sites to scale. FE's listings trend toward cash-flowing, stable assets that justify premium multiples—not turnaround projects.

## The Listing Process: What FE Demands Before Going Live

FE's onboarding requires 4-6 weeks of data aggregation before listing. Expect to provide:

**Financial records:** Profit & loss statements for the trailing 24 months, reconciled to bank statements. FE's analysts will identify discrepancies between claimed earnings and actual deposits, so clean your books before engaging. They'll reject listings with unexplained cash flow gaps or inconsistent expense categorization.

**Traffic documentation:** Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and ad network dashboards with unfiltered data. FE cross-references GA traffic with ad impressions to detect inflated pageview reporting. For due diligence prep, see [google-search-console-audit-before-buying.html](google-search-console-audit-before-buying.html).

**Content inventory:** Full article list with publication dates, word counts, and authorship. FE buyers scrutinize content quality and will discount valuations if they detect AI-generated slop or spun content. Sites built on outsourced content from Fiverr or content mills face 15-25% valuation haircuts.

**Backlink profile:** Ahrefs or SEMrush exports showing referring domains, anchor text distribution, and link velocity. FE buyers fear **Google penalties** from PBN links or spammy guest post networks. Clean toxic links before listing or prepare to accept valuation discounts.

**Operating procedures:** SOPs (standard operating procedures) for content production, monetization optimization, and technical maintenance. Turnkey businesses command premium multiples; operator-reliant businesses get compressed valuations or don't list at all.

FE rejects 40-50% of listing applications. Common rejection reasons include inconsistent traffic trends, unexplained revenue volatility, thin content, reliance on a single traffic source, or financial records that don't reconcile.

## Due Diligence Intensity: FE Buyers Dissect Everything

Once FE identifies a buyer, expect 30-60 days of due diligence where the buyer's team audits:

**Traffic sustainability:** Buyers deploy tools to verify organic traffic isn't propped up by expired PBN links, paid traffic disguised as organic, or temporary ranking boosts from **Google algorithm volatility**. They'll request GSC API access to cross-check FE's traffic claims. For insights into what buyers scrutinize in GSC data, see [google-ranking-factors-for-buyers.html](google-ranking-factors-for-buyers.html).

**Revenue verification:** Buyers demand read-only access to ad network dashboards, affiliate program accounts, and Stripe/PayPal transaction histories. They'll compare revenue screenshots in the FE listing against raw platform data. Discrepancies kill deals instantly.

**Content originality:** Buyers run Copyscape or AI detection tools across your article catalog. If more than 10% of content triggers plagiarism or AI flags, expect renegotiation or deal termination. For positioning on AI content concerns, see discussions in [future-of-website-flipping-trends.html](future-of-website-flipping-trends.html).

**Technical debt:** Buyers audit site speed, Core Web Vitals, SSL implementation, and CMS security. Sites running outdated WordPress versions or vulnerable plugins face 5-10% purchase price reductions to account for post-acquisition remediation costs.

**Legal compliance:** Buyers verify FTC affiliate disclosure compliance, GDPR cookie consent (for EU traffic), and CCPA privacy policies (for California traffic). Non-compliance triggers immediate legal review and potential deal collapse. For compliance baselines, see [ftc-affiliate-disclosure-requirements.html](ftc-affiliate-disclosure-requirements.html) and [gdpr-compliance-acquired-european-sites.html](gdpr-compliance-acquired-european-sites.html).

FE facilitates this due diligence through secure data rooms (Dropbox or Google Drive folders with tiered access). Their transaction coordinators chase down buyer requests and translate technical findings into negotiation terms.

## Deal Structures FE Facilitates: Cash, Seller Notes, Earnouts

FE's default deal structure is:

**70-90% cash at close:** Wired to escrow (Escrow.com or FE's preferred provider) and released upon successful asset transfer.

**10-20% seller note:** Two-year promissory note with interest (5-8%), secured by the asset itself. If the business collapses post-sale, the buyer defaults and you reclaim the asset—though by then it's often degraded. Seller notes bridge valuation gaps and signal confidence in the asset's sustainability.

**Earnouts (SaaS-specific):** For high-growth SaaS businesses, buyers propose earnouts where 20-30% of the purchase price pays out over 12-24 months contingent on revenue or MRR retention targets. FE structures these carefully to avoid disputes, but earnouts introduce risk—if the buyer mismanages the business post-acquisition, you forfeit the earnout portion.

**All-cash deals** are rare outside of PE roll-ups or buyers with institutional backing. If a buyer offers 100% cash at close, scrutinize their proof of funds and ensure escrow terms protect against wire fraud.

## FE's Geographic Reach: US, UK, EU, APAC

FE operates globally with offices in the US, UK, and APAC. This geographic distribution matters for:

**Tax optimization:** Structuring deals through FE's UK or Singapore entities can create favorable tax treatment depending on your residency and the buyer's jurisdiction. Consult a CPA before assuming US tax treatment applies.

**Currency hedging:** If you're a US seller and the buyer is EU-based, FE can structure payments in USD, EUR, or GBP. Currency fluctuations between LOI and close can swing proceeds by 5-10%, so lock exchange rates in the purchase agreement.

**Legal jurisdiction:** FE defaults to Delaware (US) or UK law for purchase agreements. If you're selling from outside these jurisdictions, ensure your attorney reviews enforceability in your home country.

## FE vs. Empire Flippers vs. Flippa: When to Choose FE

For portfolio operators deciding where to list:

**Choose FE if:**
- Asset value exceeds $200K and you want maximum sale price, not speed
- Business has recurring revenue (SaaS, membership, retainer services)
- You lack M&A experience and need transaction hand-holding
- Confidentiality matters (you're still operating the business)

**Choose Empire Flippers if:**
- Asset value is $50K-$500K and you want balance between service quality and fees (10-15% commission, similar to FE but faster close times)
- You're comfortable managing some due diligence yourself

**Choose Flippa if:**
- Asset value is under $100K and you prioritize speed over price
- You're willing to self-manage due diligence and legal paperwork
- Buyer vetting isn't critical (you'll field many unqualified inquiries)

## FE's Weaknesses: Where Premium Service Falls Short

**Listing exclusivity:** FE requires 6-month exclusive listing agreements. If they fail to sell your asset within six months, you've lost half a year of opportunity to list elsewhere. Negotiate 90-day exclusivity with a 30-day out clause if FE doesn't produce qualified LOIs.

**Analyst quality variance:** FE's valuation and listing quality depends on which analyst manages your deal. Junior analysts miss revenue optimization opportunities or misrepresent asset positioning, suppressing sale price. Request a senior analyst if your asset exceeds $500K or has complex revenue streams.

**Slow close times:** FE's average time-to-close is 120-150 days from listing to wire transfer. If you need liquidity urgently, FE's process will frustrate you. Motion Invest closes deals in 30-45 days; FE prioritizes deal quality over speed.

**Limited post-sale support:** Once escrow releases, FE's involvement ends. If the buyer discovers issues during asset transfer or disputes arise over representations in the purchase agreement, you'll need your own attorney. FE doesn't mediate post-close disputes.

## Preparing for FE: Pre-Listing Optimization Checklist

Maximize your FE sale price by addressing these pre-listing:

1. **Stabilize traffic:** Ensure 6+ months of flat or growing organic traffic. Buyers discount assets with volatile traffic patterns.
2. **Diversify revenue:** Sites monetized solely through AdSense or a single affiliate program sell at 10-15% discounts. Add secondary revenue streams (sponsored content, digital products, email list monetization).
3. **Document SOPs:** Even if you operate the business solo, create written procedures for content publishing, monetization optimization, and technical maintenance. Turnkey documentation adds 5-10% to valuation multiples.
4. **Clean backlink profile:** Use Ahrefs to identify and disavow toxic links. Buyers will audit this, and PBN footprints trigger immediate valuation haircuts.
5. **Upgrade hosting and security:** Migrate to reputable managed WordPress hosting (Kinsta, WP Engine) and implement SSL, firewalls, and automated backups. Buyers fear inheriting hacked sites or unstable infrastructure.
6. **Build email list:** Even a small engaged email list (1,000+ subscribers with 20%+ open rates) adds 10-15% to content site valuations. Email lists signal audience ownership independent of Google.

FE International earns its premium by converting six-figure website exits into institutional-grade transactions. For operators targeting $200K+ exits who lack M&A expertise, FE's buyer vetting, transaction management, and confidentiality protections justify the 10-15% commission. Below $200K, self-listing or lower-fee brokerages preserve more proceeds without sacrificing deal quality.
