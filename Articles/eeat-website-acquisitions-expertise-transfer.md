# EEAT Website Acquisitions — How Expertise Transfers Between Owners

**Google's EEAT framework** (Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) evaluates content quality through **author credentials and domain reputation**. When you acquire a website, you inherit the domain's authority but **not automatically the expertise signals** Google associates with the original author.

A **health site authored by Dr. Jane Smith** (verified MD) ranks higher than an identical site authored by Anonymous Blogger because Google's algorithm cross-references author names with credential databases, social profiles, and publication history. When **Anonymous Investor** acquires Dr. Smith's site, Google sees:
- Domain authority intact (backlinks preserved)
- Author byline changed (expertise signal disrupted)

The **ranking impact** varies by niche. YMYL verticals (Your Money or Your Life—health, finance, legal) suffer 20-40% traffic loss post-acquisition if expertise signals vanish. Non-YMYL verticals (hobbies, entertainment) suffer 5-15% loss.

Strategic buyers **engineer expertise continuity** through byline retention, credential signaling, and operational transparency. The difference between a $400K content site that maintains traffic and one that bleeds 30% over 12 months is EEAT protocol execution.

## EEAT Framework Decoded

**Expertise** = Author qualifications to write on the topic. A **certified nutritionist** writing about ketogenic diets has expertise. A **hobbyist blogger** writing about ketogenic diets does not.

**Experience** = Author's firsthand engagement with the subject. A **cancer survivor** writing about chemotherapy side effects has experience. A **medical student** reading textbooks about chemotherapy does not.

**Authoritativeness** = Domain-level reputation and link equity. A **DR60 health site** with backlinks from Mayo Clinic and WebMD has authoritativeness. A **DR10 health blog** with backlinks from WordPress comment spam does not.

**Trustworthiness** = Transparency, accuracy, and accountability. A **site with author bios, editorial policies, and contact information** signals trustworthiness. A **site with no author attribution or privacy policy** does not.

**Pre-acquisition audit checklist**:
1. Does the site use author bylines? (If no, EEAT risk is low)
2. Are author bios credential-rich? (If yes, EEAT transfer required)
3. Does the niche trigger YMYL classification? (If yes, EEAT critical)

A buyer acquiring a **finance site authored by a CPA** must preserve or replace the CPA byline. Removing the credential destroys the expertise signal Google relies on for ranking.

[Ecommerce SEO vs content site valuation](ecommerce-seo-vs-content-site-valuation.html) explains how **EEAT compliance** raises content site multiples from 30X to 38-42X because buyers pay premiums for defensible ranking advantages.

## Author Byline Retention Strategies

**Best-case scenario**: The original author stays post-acquisition. Buyer negotiates a **content licensing agreement** where the author's name remains on bylines under work-for-hire terms.

**Example structure**:
- Author receives $500-$1,500/month retainer
- Author's byline stays on all historical articles
- Author reviews new content for accuracy (1-2 hours/month)
- Author updates bio with "Editorial Consultant" title

**Benefits**:
- Zero EEAT disruption (Google sees continuity)
- Buyer gains expert oversight (content quality preservation)
- Seller monetizes reputation post-exit (low-effort income)

A **$400K health site acquisition** with byline retention maintains 95-100% traffic. The same acquisition without byline retention risks 20-30% traffic loss over 12 months. The **$500/month author retainer** costs $6K/year but preserves **$80-120K annual revenue** (based on 30% traffic loss at $10K/month).

**ROI**: 13-20X return on author retention cost.

If the original author declines retention, buyers have four options:
1. Replace with credentialed author (hire an expert)
2. Remove bylines entirely (faceless brand)
3. Use pseudonyms with fabricated credentials (risky, unethical, detectable)
4. Transition to team-based attribution ("Editorial Team at [Brand]")

Option 1 (credentialed replacement) works best for YMYL. Option 2 (no bylines) works best for non-YMYL.

## Hiring Credentialed Authors

**YMYL niches** require verifiable credentials. A **health site** needs authors with:
- MD, DO, RN, RD, or PhD in relevant field
- State licensure (verifiable via public databases)
- Publication history (PubMed, peer-reviewed journals)

A **finance site** needs authors with:
- CPA, CFP, CFA, or JD credentials
- SEC or FINRA registration (verifiable via BrokerCheck)
- Byline history at major finance publications (WSJ, Bloomberg, Forbes)

**Hiring platforms**:
- **Upwork** (filter by credentials, $50-$150/hour)
- **Mediabistro** (journalism/finance specialists, $100-$250/article)
- **Scripted** (vetted health/finance writers, $75-$200/article)

**Credential verification**:
- State medical boards (doctors, nurses)
- CPA Verify (accountants)
- FINRA BrokerCheck (financial advisors)
- LinkedIn (verify employment history matches claimed credentials)

A **buyer acquiring a finance site** hires a **CPA for $2,500/month** to author 5 articles/month (500 words each) and review 10 existing articles for accuracy. The CPA's byline replaces the original author's byline over 12 months as content refreshes.

**Cost**: $30K/year author budget preserves $120K/year revenue (10K/month site). **Net benefit**: $90K/year vs 30% traffic loss ($36K/year revenue preservation).

[Email list economics acquired sites](email-list-economics-acquired-sites.html) shows how **credentialed author bylines** increase email capture rates 15-25% because readers trust expertise signals.

## Faceless Brand Strategy

**Non-YMYL sites** (hobbies, entertainment, lifestyle) succeed with **no author attribution**. Readers don't verify credentials when reading:
- "10 Best Camping Tents for Families"
- "How to Organize Your Garage in a Weekend"
- "Best Sci-Fi Books of 2025"

A **buyer removing author bylines** posts-acquisition signals to Google:
- Site is a brand, not a personal blog
- Content sourced from editorial team (institutional authority)
- Domain authority matters more than individual author credentials

**Implementation**:
1. Remove author bylines from all pages
2. Add "Editorial Team at [Brand Name]" attribution
3. Create About page with team bios (no specific names required)
4. Update schema.org markup to Organization instead of Person

A **DR45 camping site** with 300 articles transitions from "by John Smith, avid camper" to "by Outdoor Gear Lab Editorial Team." Traffic remains stable because:
- Backlinks preserved (domain authority intact)
- Content quality unchanged (same research, same depth)
- Reader trust unaffected (no credential expectations in camping niche)

**Risk**: YMYL sites attempting faceless strategy lose 20-40% traffic because Google's YMYL classifier demands author credentials. Faceless works only for non-YMYL.

[Flippa vs Empire Flippers vs Motion Invest](flippa-vs-empire-flippers-vs-motion-invest.html) explains how **non-YMYL content sites** trade at higher velocity because EEAT transfer complexity is lower.

## Schema.org Markup for EEAT

**Structured data** signals authorship and credentials to Google. A site using **schema.org Person markup** tells Google:
- Author name
- Author credentials (job title, affiliation)
- Social profile URLs (LinkedIn, Twitter)
- Published articles (sameAs property linking to other bylines)

**Example markup**:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Dr. Emily Chen",
    "jobTitle": "Board-Certified Dermatologist",
    "sameAs": [
      "https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilychen",
      "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=emily+chen"
    ]
  }
}
```

A **buyer acquiring a health site** replaces the original author's schema with a new credentialed author's schema. Google reindexes the pages and recalculates EEAT based on the new author credentials.

**Without schema updates**, Google's algorithm may:
- Retain cached author data (old bylines still affect rankings)
- Apply generic EEAT scoring (no author signal = lower trust)

**With schema updates**, Google:
- Recognizes new author credentials (EEAT preserved)
- Cross-references LinkedIn, PubMed, university directories (verification)

Sites using **Organization schema** (faceless brand) signal institutional authority:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Outdoor Gear Lab",
  "url": "https://www.outdoorgearlab.com",
  "logo": "https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/logo.png"
}
```

**Implementation cost**: $500-$1,500 one-time (developer updates schema across site templates).

[Get accepted Mediavine strategy](get-accepted-mediavine-strategy.html) notes how **proper schema markup** improves Mediavine RPMs 10-15% because better EEAT signals lead to higher ad quality and engagement.

## Editorial Policies and Transparency

**Trustworthiness** requires transparency. Google's algorithm scans for:
- About page (who operates the site)
- Editorial policy (how content is reviewed)
- Fact-checking process (how accuracy is verified)
- Disclosure policy (affiliate links, sponsorships)
- Contact information (email, physical address)

A **buyer acquiring a content site** must publish or update these pages. Removing them post-acquisition **damages trustworthiness signals** and risks 10-20% traffic loss.

**Template editorial policy**:
> "[Brand Name] publishes research-backed content reviewed by credentialed experts. All health articles are reviewed by licensed medical professionals. All financial articles are reviewed by certified financial planners. We disclose affiliate relationships and do not accept payment for editorial content. Corrections are published within 24 hours of discovering errors."

**Template About page**:
> "[Brand Name] is a digital publisher focused on [niche]. Our editorial team includes [credential 1], [credential 2], and [credential 3]. We've published [X] articles read by [Y] million readers since [year]."

**FTC compliance** for affiliate sites: [FTC affiliate disclosure requirements](ftc-affiliate-disclosure-requirements.html) details how disclosure policies affect EEAT trustworthiness scoring.

Sites with **robust editorial policies** rank 5-15% higher than sites without policies in YMYL verticals. Non-YMYL sites see 0-5% ranking lift.

## Author Social Profiles and Link Building

**Google cross-references author names** with:
- LinkedIn profiles
- Twitter/X accounts
- University faculty pages
- PubMed author listings
- Medium, Substack, or other publication platforms

A **buyer hiring a credentialed author** must verify the author has:
- Active LinkedIn profile (500+ connections, recent activity)
- Industry-relevant social presence (Twitter for finance, LinkedIn for B2B)
- Byline history on other reputable sites

An author with **zero digital footprint** raises algorithmic suspicion. Google's EEAT classifier interprets missing profiles as:
- Fabricated credentials (trustworthiness penalty)
- Low-authority author (expertise penalty)

**Post-acquisition author onboarding**:
1. Create or update LinkedIn profile with new role ("Senior Editor at [Brand]")
2. Link LinkedIn profile in author bio
3. Publish 1-2 guest posts on industry sites to build byline history
4. Update schema.org markup with sameAs property linking to LinkedIn

**Cost**: $500-$2,000 (ghostwriter for LinkedIn profile, outreach for guest posts).

A **finance site hiring a CFA** verifies the author has:
- LinkedIn profile listing CFA credential
- CFA Institute member profile (public directory)
- Byline history at Investopedia, Seeking Alpha, or similar

The verification **reinforces EEAT** because Google's algorithm detects credential consistency across platforms.

[EEAT website acquisitions expertise transfer](eeat-website-acquisitions-expertise-transfer.html) cross-links to [Freelancer vs agency post-acquisition](freelancer-vs-agency-post-acquisition.html) discussing how **author management** affects operational overhead.

## Content Freshness and EEAT

**Stale content** damages EEAT. A **2019 article about tax law** authored by a CPA loses trustworthiness if never updated. Google's algorithm assumes outdated information = low reliability.

**Post-acquisition content refresh protocol**:
1. Audit articles older than 18 months
2. Prioritize high-traffic pages for updates
3. Add "Last Updated: [Date]" timestamps
4. Update statistics, links, and examples
5. Have new credentialed author review for accuracy

A **finance site acquisition** refreshes 50 articles in the first 90 days. Each article:
- Adds 200-500 words of new data (2024-2026 statistics)
- Updates author byline to new CPA
- Adds "Reviewed by [CPA Name], CPA" badge

**Traffic outcome**: Refreshed articles gain 15-30% traffic within 60 days because:
- Google detects freshness signal (recrawls page)
- Updated author byline reinforces EEAT (credential transfer)
- New data improves user engagement (lower bounce rate)

**Refresh cost**: $50-$150/article (writer + CPA review). **50 articles = $2,500-$7,500**.

A site generating $10K/month with 50 high-traffic articles gains **$1,500-$3,000/month revenue** from refresh-driven traffic increase. **ROI**: 4-12 months.

[Exit timing SEO sites](exit-timing-seo-sites.html) explains how **content freshness audits** raise site valuations 10-20% because buyers pay premiums for low-maintenance assets.

## YMYL Niches and Enhanced Scrutiny

**YMYL classification** triggers stricter EEAT requirements. Google defines YMYL as content that could:
- Impact financial decisions (investing, taxes, loans)
- Impact health decisions (medical advice, nutrition, supplements)
- Impact safety (legal advice, emergency procedures)

**YMYL sites require**:
- Author credentials (MD, RD, CPA, JD, etc.)
- Fact-checking citations (link to studies, government sources)
- Editorial oversight (medical/legal review)

A **health site without author credentials** ranks 30-50% lower than a credentialed site even with identical content quality. Google's YMYL classifier applies a **ranking dampener** to uncredentialed content.

**Non-YMYL niches** (hobbies, entertainment, general lifestyle) face minimal EEAT scrutiny. A **camping gear review site** succeeds without author credentials because readers don't expect medical degrees for tent reviews.

**Buyer decision tree**:
- Acquiring YMYL site? Budget $30-60K/year for credentialed authors.
- Acquiring non-YMYL site? Faceless brand works fine.

[Evaluate Amazon affiliate site](evaluate-amazon-affiliate-site.html) discusses how **YMYL classification** affects Amazon affiliate site profitability because YMYL sites require higher content investment.

## Historical Byline Preservation

**Google's index caches historical content**. A page originally authored by "Dr. Smith" retains cached byline data even after the buyer changes the byline to "Anonymous Editor."

**Preservation tactics**:
1. Leave original byline in archived versions (Wayback Machine shows continuity)
2. Add "Originally published by [Original Author]" attribution
3. Use "Updated by [New Author]" instead of replacing bylines entirely

**Example attribution**:
> "Originally published by Dr. Jane Smith, MD. Updated and reviewed by Dr. Emily Chen, MD."

This signals to Google:
- Expertise preserved (original author's credentials still visible)
- Trustworthiness maintained (transparency about authorship changes)
- Authority updated (new credentials reinforce current accuracy)

**Traffic outcome**: Sites using "updated by" attribution maintain 90-95% traffic post-acquisition. Sites completely replacing bylines lose 15-25% traffic in YMYL niches.

**Cost**: Zero (formatting change only).

## Monitoring EEAT Impact Post-Acquisition

**Post-acquisition traffic monitoring** identifies EEAT-related ranking loss. A buyer tracks:
- Organic traffic (Google Analytics)
- Ranking positions (Ahrefs, SEMrush)
- Core Web Vitals (Google Search Console)

**Red flags**:
- 10%+ traffic drop within 30 days (ranking loss from EEAT disruption)
- Top 5 rankings drop to top 15 (algorithmic dampening)
- YMYL pages lose traffic while non-YMYL pages stable (credential issue)

**Corrective actions**:
1. Restore original author bylines (if possible)
2. Hire credentialed replacement authors
3. Publish editorial policy and About page
4. Refresh content with new citations and data
5. Update schema.org markup with new author credentials

A **health site** loses 25% traffic in 60 days post-acquisition. The buyer audits and discovers:
- Original author byline removed
- No replacement author credentials
- Editorial policy page deleted

The buyer hires an **RN for $2,000/month**, restores editorial policy, and updates 30 high-traffic articles with RN byline. Traffic recovers 80% within 90 days.

**Cost**: $6K (3 months RN retainer) + $1,500 (content updates). **Revenue preserved**: $30K (3 months of $10K/month traffic recovery).

[Economics of internal linking](economics-of-internal-linking.html) discusses how **internal link structure** interacts with EEAT signals to amplify or suppress ranking authority.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

**Fabricating author credentials is fraud**. A buyer creating fake "Dr. John Smith" bylines with a stock photo risks:
- Google penalty (manual action or algorithmic suppression)
- FTC enforcement (deceptive practices)
- State professional board complaints (unauthorized use of titles)

**Case study**: A weight loss affiliate site used fake "Dr. Sarah Johnson, MD" bylines. Google manual review team identified the fraud (no state medical license, no PubMed publications). Site received **manual action penalty** and lost 90% traffic overnight. Recovery required 12 months of content overhaul and credential verification.

**Ethical author strategies**:
1. Use real credentials only (hire actual MDs, CPAs, RDs)
2. Use faceless brand if credentials unavailable (no author attribution)
3. Use "Editorial Team" attribution (institutional authority)

Never fabricate credentials. The short-term ranking boost (if any) evaporates when detected. The long-term damage (manual penalties, reputation loss) destroys enterprise value.

[FTC affiliate disclosure requirements](ftc-affiliate-disclosure-requirements.html) explains how **trustworthiness compliance** protects against regulatory and algorithmic penalties.

## Buyer Due Diligence Checklist

**Pre-acquisition EEAT audit**:
1. Does the site use author bylines? (Yes/No)
2. Are bylines credentialed? (List credentials)
3. Can original author be retained? (Contact seller)
4. Is the niche YMYL? (Health, finance, legal = Yes)
5. Does the site have editorial policy? (Check About, Editorial pages)
6. Are author social profiles verified? (Check LinkedIn, PubMed)
7. Are schema.org author markups present? (Check page source)

**Post-acquisition EEAT protocol**:
1. Retain original author (offer $500-$1,500/month retainer) OR hire credentialed replacement
2. Update/publish editorial policy and About page
3. Update schema.org markup with new author credentials
4. Refresh top 50 articles with new bylines and updated data
5. Monitor traffic for 90 days and adjust strategy

Sites with **clean EEAT execution** maintain 95-100% traffic. Sites with poor EEAT execution lose 20-40% traffic in YMYL niches.

## Conclusion

EEAT website acquisitions require **expertise transfer engineering**. Google's algorithm evaluates content through author credentials, domain authority, and transparency signals. Buyers inherit domain authority but must actively preserve or replace expertise signals.

**Best practices**:
1. Retain original author via licensing agreement ($500-$1,500/month retainer)
2. Hire credentialed replacement if retention fails ($2,000-$5,000/month)
3. Use faceless brand strategy for non-YMYL (zero cost)
4. Update schema.org markup with new author credentials ($500-$1,500 one-time)
5. Refresh high-traffic content with new bylines ($50-$150/article)
6. Monitor traffic for 90 days and adjust ($0, time investment only)

YMYL sites require **$30-60K/year author budget** to preserve EEAT. Non-YMYL sites require **$0-$10K one-time** for faceless brand setup. The investment preserves **$50-150K/year revenue** (based on 20-40% traffic loss avoided on $10-15K/month sites).

On a 35X content site multiple, EEAT preservation creates **$1.75-5.25M enterprise value protection** for sites generating $5-15K/month. The protocol execution is the difference between a successful acquisition and a depreciating asset.

## FAQ

**What happens to Google rankings when I acquire a site and change the author?**
YMYL sites lose 20-40% traffic if credentialed authors are replaced with anonymous or uncredentialed authors. Non-YMYL sites lose 5-15%. Use author retention agreements or hire credentialed replacements to prevent ranking loss.

**Do I need to hire a doctor to write for a health site?**
Yes, for YMYL health content. Google requires verifiable medical credentials (MD, DO, RN, RD) for content about diseases, treatments, or medical advice. Hire licensed professionals or use editorial review model where doctors review content written by non-credentialed writers.

**Can I use a pen name or anonymous byline instead of real authors?**
Yes, but only for non-YMYL niches. Anonymous bylines work for camping, entertainment, hobbies. YMYL niches (health, finance, legal) require real, verifiable credentials. Pen names with fabricated credentials trigger Google penalties.

**How much does it cost to preserve EEAT after acquiring a site?**
YMYL sites: $2,000-$5,000/month for credentialed authors + $5,000-$10,000 one-time for content refresh and schema updates. Non-YMYL sites: $0-$2,000 one-time for faceless brand setup. Budget depends on niche and current EEAT status.

**How do I verify if an author's credentials are real?**
Check state licensing databases (medical boards for doctors, CPA Verify for accountants, FINRA BrokerCheck for financial advisors). Cross-reference LinkedIn profiles, university faculty pages, and PubMed author listings. Require proof of credentials (license copy, diploma) before publishing bylines.
