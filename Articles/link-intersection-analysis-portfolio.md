# Link Intersection Analysis for Portfolio Sites: Finding Shared Backlink Sources

**Link intersection analysis portfolio** identifies domains linking to 2-5 competitors simultaneously—revealing publishers actively covering your niche and willing to add links from new sources. Manual link prospecting generates 200-300 targets requiring 60+ hours research and 5-12% conversion rates. Intersection analysis surfaces 40-80 pre-qualified targets in 30 minutes with 18-28% conversion rates because these publishers already demonstrated interest in your topic by linking to similar sites.

## Competitive Link Intersection Methodology

**Ahrefs Link Intersect Tool** compares backlink profiles of up to 10 domains, showing sites linking to multiple targets but not to your site. The optimal comparison analyzes 3-5 competitors because:
- **2 competitors:** Too narrow, misses publishers who favor one competitor over another
- **3-5 competitors:** Sweet spot, captures publishers covering the niche broadly
- **6-10 competitors:** Too broad, surfaces generic directories and irrelevant link sources

**Selection criteria for comparison domains:**
1. Similar niche focus (compare "project management software reviews" sites, not general "business software" sites)
2. Comparable domain authority (±20 DR from your site avoids aspirational outliers)
3. Active sites (updated within 6 months, showing current link acquisition)

Example: Your DR35 project management review site compares against:
- Competitor A: DR42, focused PM reviews
- Competitor B: DR38, PM + collaboration tools
- Competitor C: DR45, SaaS reviews with PM category

This trio identifies publishers linking to mid-authority PM-focused sites—your addressable target universe.

## Filtering and Qualifying Intersection Results

Raw intersection results contain 200-500 domains including spam directories, forum profiles, and irrelevant sites. **Multi-stage filtering** narrows to 30-60 high-value targets:

**Stage 1 — Domain authority filter:**
- Exclude DR <30 (minimal ranking value)
- Prioritize DR 40-60 (strong authority, reachable via outreach)
- Flag DR 60+ (aspirational targets requiring premium pitches)

**Stage 2 — Traffic filter:**
- Require 1,000+ monthly organic traffic (Ahrefs traffic estimate)
- Prioritize 5,000-50,000 monthly traffic (active sites with audience)
- Exclude 100K+ traffic unless highly relevant (major media rarely accept guest posts)

**Stage 3 — Topical relevance:**
- Check linking page content (does it discuss your niche or tangentially mention it?)
- Verify contextual link placement (in-content links > sidebar/footer links)
- Confirm editorial style (resource lists, roundups, how-to guides accept new submissions)

**Stage 4 — Link velocity:**
- Calculate monthly new referring domains (Ahrefs "New" backlinks report)
- Target sites gaining 3-10 RDs monthly (active link building signals openness to outreach)
- Avoid sites gaining 50+ RDs monthly (likely spammy or automated)

A 400-domain raw intersection becomes 45 qualified targets after filtering—these sites have authority, traffic, relevance, and demonstrated willingness to link within your niche.

## Categorizing Link Opportunities by Type

**Resource pages** (30-40% of intersection results) maintain curated lists of tools, guides, or references. Identifiers:
- URLs containing "resources," "tools," "links," "directory"
- Page titles like "Best Project Management Tools" or "PM Resources"
- Content structure: numbered lists or categorized link collections

Resource pages offer 40-55% success rates because they're designed to aggregate links. Pitch format: concise email explaining why your content deserves inclusion, highlighting unique value (original data, comprehensive coverage, expert authorship).

**Roundup posts** (20-30% of intersection results) compile "best of" lists or expert roundups. Identifiers:
- Titles containing "best," "top," "comparison," "vs"
- Recent publication dates (roundups get updated annually)
- Multiple outbound links to similar content types

Roundup success rates: 25-35%. Timing matters—pitch during annual update cycles (Q4 for "best of year" posts, seasonal for niche-specific roundups). Position your content as superior to existing inclusions, offering fresh perspective for the next update.

**Guest post opportunities** (15-25% of intersection results) come from sites accepting contributed articles. Identifiers:
- "Write for us" or "Contribute" pages
- Bylined articles from external authors
- Editorial guidelines mentioning guest submissions

Guest post success rates: 15-25% for cold outreach, 35-50% if you've engaged with publisher content first (commenting, sharing, citing their work in your content). These placements offer maximum control—you write surrounding context, optimize anchor text, and embed relevant CTAs.

**Editorial mentions** (10-15% of intersection results) happen when publishers naturally reference useful content. These are hardest to secure (5-10% success via outreach) but highest value because editorial links carry strongest ranking signals. Secure through:
- Creating linkable assets (original studies, data visualizations, calculators)
- HARO (Help A Reporter Out) responses providing expert quotes
- Publisher relationships cultivated over 6-12 months

## Outreach Sequencing and Pitch Optimization

**Tiered outreach** prioritizes high-conversion opportunities before burning time on long-shots:

**Week 1-2 — Tier 1 (Resource pages + recent roundups):**
- 15-25 targets with 40-55% conversion potential
- Personalized emails referencing specific pages
- Pitch format: "I noticed you listed [Competitor X] in your PM tools resource. Have you considered [Your Content]? It includes [unique differentiator]."

**Week 3-4 — Tier 2 (Older roundups + niche blogs):**
- 20-30 targets with 25-35% conversion potential
- Semi-personalized emails (template with custom intro paragraph)
- Pitch format: "Your article on [topic] from [date] was really helpful. I recently published [Your Content] covering [angle]. Would you consider adding it?"

**Week 5-6 — Tier 3 (Guest post opportunities):**
- 15-20 targets with 15-25% conversion potential
- Full pitch with article topic ideas
- Pitch format: "I've been following [Site Name] and appreciate your coverage of [niche]. I'd love to contribute a guest post on [Topic]. Here are three angles I could take: [Idea 1, 2, 3]."

**Tier 4 (Editorial mentions):**
- Ongoing cultivation, not time-boxed
- Share publisher content on social, comment thoughtfully, cite in your articles
- Reach out after 2-3 meaningful interactions, not cold

This sequencing generates 8-15 successful links from 60-75 outreach attempts over 6 weeks—20% conversion rate vs 5-8% for non-intersection prospecting.

## Multi-Site Portfolio Link Intersection

**Cross-portfolio analysis** identifies link sources willing to cover multiple properties in your portfolio. If you operate three sites (project management, CRM reviews, marketing automation), intersection analysis across YOUR sites reveals:
- Publishers who cover SaaS broadly (prime targets for all three sites)
- Publishers specializing in workflow tools (target for PM + CRM sites)
- Publishers focused on marketing tech (target for CRM + marketing automation)

**Efficiency gains:**
- One publisher relationship yields 2-3 links across portfolio
- Shared outreach costs (one email template adapted for three pitches)
- Credibility transfer (success on Site A improves acceptance rate for Site B pitch)

Example workflow:
1. Run Ahrefs Link Intersect for Site A + Site B (your properties) vs 3 competitors
2. Identify publishers linking to both your sites already (they love your content)
3. Pitch remaining portfolio sites to those publishers (highest conversion rate)
4. Identify publishers linking to only one of your sites
5. Pitch the other sites (moderate conversion rate)

A portfolio operator securing 12 links via intersection analysis might place 4 links on one site, 5 on another, 3 on the third—distributing authority while amortizing outreach costs across properties.

## Temporal Analysis and Link Opportunity Freshness

**Backlink recency** indicates publisher activity and openness to new links. Sites that added links to competitors in the past 90 days are actively updating content—ideal outreach timing. Sites whose most recent competitor link is 2+ years old may have stopped accepting submissions or shifted focus.

**Ahrefs filtering** by link acquisition date:
1. Export intersection results to CSV
2. Check "First Seen" date for each backlink
3. Prioritize targets with links added in past 6 months
4. Secondary priority: links added 6-12 months ago
5. Deprioritize: links >2 years old (verify site still active before outreach)

**Seasonal patterns** emerge in link acquisition. Sites publishing "Best [Category] Tools 2026" roundups update in Q4 2025/Q1 2026—outreach in September-November captures update cycle. Sites updating quarterly (March, June, September, December) require precise timing for inclusion.

Calendar-based outreach planning:
- Q1 (Jan-Mar): Target sites updating annual roundups post-publication
- Q2 (Apr-Jun): Resource page updates (spring cleaning)
- Q3 (Jul-Sep): Pitch for Q4 roundup consideration
- Q4 (Oct-Dec): Year-end list submissions + holiday publishing slowdowns (pause outreach Dec 15-Jan 5)

## Competitive Gap Analysis and Differentiation

**Competitor backlink advantages** surface when you analyze sites linking to 3-5 competitors but not to you. These gaps indicate:
1. **Awareness gap:** Publishers don't know your site exists (solve via outreach)
2. **Quality gap:** Your content doesn't meet publisher standards (solve via content improvement)
3. **Relationship gap:** Competitors have established publisher relationships (solve via long-term engagement)

**Diagnosing gap types:**
- If your DR matches competitors and content quality is similar → Awareness gap (outreach solves this)
- If your DR is 15+ points lower → Quality/Authority gap (build more links before approaching premium publishers)
- If competitors cite each other in content, appear on podcasts together, collaborate → Relationship gap (join niche communities, engage consistently for 6-12 months)

**Content gap correlation:**
Check if competitor backlinks target content types you haven't produced:
- Competitors have data studies, you don't → Create original research to attract editorial links
- Competitors have comparison pages, you don't → Build vs pages for software products
- Competitors have expert roundups, you don't → Interview 15-20 niche experts for a mega-guide

Filling content gaps before intersection outreach increases acceptance rates 30-50% because you're pitching comparable value.

## Automation and Scale Link Intersection

**Bulk intersection analysis** for operators managing 5+ sites:

**Ahrefs Batch Analysis:**
1. Create competitor lists for each site (3-5 competitors per site)
2. Run intersection analysis for Site 1 vs its competitor set
3. Export results to CSV
4. Repeat for Sites 2-5
5. Combine CSVs, deduplicate domains appearing across multiple analyses
6. Run unified filtering (DR, traffic, relevance) across combined dataset

This surfaces 80-150 unique domains linking to multiple competitor sets—highest-leverage targets for portfolio-wide outreach.

**Prospecting tools** that integrate intersection analysis:
- **Pitchbox** ($195-495/month) — Automates intersection analysis + outreach sequencing
- **BuzzStream** ($24-999/month) — CRM for tracking intersection prospects through outreach stages
- **Hunter.io** ($49-399/month) — Email finding for intersection domains lacking public contact info

For portfolios under 3 sites: manual Ahrefs intersection + spreadsheet tracking suffices. For 5+ sites with aggressive link building (100+ links annually), paid tools amortize costs through time savings and conversion tracking.

## FAQ

### How many competitors should you analyze in link intersection?

Three to five competitors produces optimal results. Two competitors miss publishers who favor one over the other. Six or more dilutes relevance—you'll surface generic link sources (directories, aggregators) that link to everyone in the space. Focus on direct competitors with similar domain authority and content focus, not category leaders 40+ DR points above you.

### Should you target sites linking to 2, 3, 4, or all 5 competitors?

Sites linking to all 5 competitors publish aggregator content (directories, massive resource lists) with lower editorial standards—easier to secure but lower ranking impact. Sites linking to only 2 competitors are more selective—harder to secure but higher authority signal. Balance: 60% of outreach to 2-3 competitor linkers (selective, high-quality), 40% to 4-5 competitor linkers (higher volume, easier wins).

### How often should you re-run link intersection analysis?

Quarterly for active link building campaigns. Publishers add new links monthly, creating fresh opportunities every 90 days. Sites you analyzed in January may have added 8-12 new intersection opportunities by April. Set calendar reminders to refresh analysis Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4—each cycle surfaces 15-25 new prospects if your competitors actively build links.

### What if intersection analysis returns too few results?

Expand competitor list (analyze 5-7 instead of 3-5) or adjust filters (lower DR threshold from 40 to 30, accept 500+ monthly traffic instead of 1,000+). If still insufficient: your niche may be under-linked (good—easier to compete) or your site significantly lags competitors in authority (focus on direct link building before intersection outreach). Alternatively, analyze adjacent niches—PM site could analyze links to "productivity tools" or "team collaboration" niches.

### Can you use link intersection to identify negative SEO or PBN networks?

Yes. If 20+ low-quality sites (DR10-25, minimal traffic, suspicious footprints) all link to the same 3-4 competitors, you've likely identified a shared PBN network. Avoid outreach to these domains—they're either spam or part of manipulative schemes. Flag them in your prospecting sheet and focus on unique, high-quality link sources instead. This protective filtering prevents wasting time on worthless or risky link prospects.
