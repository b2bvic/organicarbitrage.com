# Evaluate Amazon Affiliate Site — Due Diligence Checklist for Buyers

**Amazon affiliate sites** generate income through **Amazon Associates commissions** (1-10% of product sales). A site driving 10,000 monthly clicks to Amazon with **3% conversion rate** and **$50 average order value** at **4% commission** earns:
- 10,000 clicks × 3% = 300 orders
- 300 orders × $50 = $15,000 sales volume
- $15,000 × 4% = **$600 monthly commission**

The economic model is fragile. **Amazon reduces commission rates unilaterally** (2020: rates dropped from 8-10% to 1-4.5% in most categories). **Amazon terminates accounts for TOS violations** (cookie stuffing, incentivized traffic, trademark bidding). **Amazon's 24-hour cookie window** means attribution expires quickly (if a user clicks but doesn't buy within 24 hours, no commission).

Buyer due diligence on Amazon affiliate sites requires **7-layer audit**: traffic sources, commission rates, TOS compliance, content quality, keyword cannibalization, diversification risk, and EEAT signals.

## Traffic Source Dependency

**Organic traffic** (Google search) is the only sustainable traffic source for Amazon affiliate sites. Buyers verify:

**90%+ organic traffic = defensible asset**
- Site ranks for **"best [product]"** keywords
- Traffic survives algorithm updates (content depth, EEAT)
- Amazon doesn't ban organic promotional methods

**Paid traffic = high risk**
- Facebook/Google Ads to Amazon affiliate links **violates Amazon TOS** (no paid traffic to affiliate links)
- Paid traffic to landing page → organic-looking click to Amazon = gray area (Amazon monitors this)
- Paid traffic unprofitable at 1-4% commission rates (CAC > commission)

**Social traffic = moderate risk**
- Pinterest, Instagram, TikTok organic posts = allowed
- Paid social ads → Amazon links = TOS violation
- Social platforms change algorithms (Pinterest suppressed affiliate links 2022-2023)

**Due diligence check**:
1. Request Google Analytics (verify traffic sources tab)
2. Filter last 90 days: Organic >85%, Direct <10%, Social <5%, Paid <1%
3. Check Search Console: Top queries match product-intent keywords

A site with **60% organic, 30% paid, 10% social** fails inspection. Paid traffic violates TOS. Buyer negotiates **40% price reduction** or walks.

[Economics of internal linking](economics-of-internal-linking.html) explains how **internal link topology** affects organic traffic resilience during algorithm updates.

## Commission Rate Verification

**Amazon Associates commission rates** vary by category (2026 structure):

| Category | Commission Rate |
|----------|----------------|
| Luxury Beauty, Amazon Coins | 10% |
| Digital Music, Physical Music, Handmade | 5% |
| Digital Videos, Physical Books | 4.5% |
| Kitchen, Automotive, Home Improvement | 4% |
| Toys, Furniture, Lawn & Garden | 3% |
| Amazon Fresh, Grocery, Health, Beauty | 1% |
| Video Games, Consoles | 1% |
| Gift Cards, Alexa Devices | 0% |

A **tech site** promoting laptops (4% category) earning **$5,000/month** seems profitable. Buyer audits Amazon Associates dashboard and discovers:
- 60% of sales are **Amazon Prime subscriptions** (0% commission, attribution tracking only)
- 30% of sales are **gift cards** (0% commission)
- 10% of sales are **actual laptops** (4% commission)

**Reality**: $5,000/month reported = $500/month actual commissions (10% of claimed revenue). Seller inflated earnings by counting non-commission sales.

**Buyer action**: Request **90-day Amazon Associates dashboard access** (not just screenshots). Download **Product Linking Report** (shows categories, commission rates, actual payouts).

**Red flags**:
- Seller refuses dashboard access (hiding low commission categories)
- Screenshots don't match date ranges (edited images)
- Commission rates claimed exceed Amazon's published rates (fraud)

## TOS Compliance Audit

**Amazon Associates TOS violations** result in **account termination and commission clawback**. Buyers inherit TOS risk if the seller violated rules pre-acquisition.

**Common violations**:
1. **Cookie stuffing** (JavaScript auto-fires Amazon links on page load)
2. **Incentivized traffic** ("Click this link and get $5 cashback")
3. **Misleading pricing** ("$99 laptop!" when actual price is $999)
4. **Trademark bidding** (Google Ads targeting "Amazon" keyword with affiliate links)
5. **Shortened links** (bit.ly, tinyurl masking affiliate tags)
6. **Email blasts with affiliate links** (Amazon prohibits affiliate links in email without prior approval)

**Due diligence process**:
1. Inspect page source code (search for "amzn.to" in JavaScript, check for auto-redirect)
2. Review historical content (Wayback Machine shows price claims, incentives)
3. Check Google Ads account (if exists—any Amazon trademark bidding?)
4. Review email archives (affiliate links in emails = violation unless approved)
5. Request **Amazon Associates account health status** (any warnings, suspensions, compliance notes)

A **$10K/month Amazon affiliate site** audit reveals:
- Seller used **cookie stuffing plugin** 18 months ago (Amazon sent warning email)
- Seller removed plugin but account remains flagged
- **Account termination risk: high**

**Buyer response**: Walk from deal. If Amazon terminates account post-acquisition, buyer loses **100% revenue** with no recourse.

[FTC affiliate disclosure requirements](ftc-affiliate-disclosure-requirements.html) explains how **disclosure compliance** intersects with Amazon TOS (both require transparent affiliate disclaimers).

## Content Quality and Depth

**Amazon affiliate sites ranking in 2026** require **comprehensive product reviews**, not thin affiliate content. Google's **Product Review Update** (2021-2024 series) rewards:
- Firsthand product testing (photos, videos, hands-on experience)
- Detailed specifications (comparison tables, technical depth)
- Pros/cons analysis (balanced, not sales-pitch)
- Alternative products (helps users make informed decisions)

**Red flags in content audit**:
- **Affiliate link density >5%** (looks spammy, risks Google penalty)
- **Identical product descriptions** (copy-pasted from Amazon listings = duplicate content)
- **No original images** (stock photos only = no firsthand testing proof)
- **Outdated content** (articles from 2018-2020 never updated)

**Buyer evaluation**:
1. Read top 10 traffic pages (are reviews detailed or thin?)
2. Check for original images (photographer credit, unique angles)
3. Verify publication dates (content <18 months old = healthy, >3 years = stale)
4. Google search top product titles (is site ranking for "best X" or buried on page 5?)

A **home improvement affiliate site** claims **$8K/month** but content audit shows:
- 80% of articles are **200-400 words** (thin content)
- Zero original images (all stock photos)
- Last updated **2021** (3+ years stale)
- **Rankings declining** (Search Console shows 40% traffic drop over 12 months)

**Buyer verdict**: Site is **algorithm update away from collapse**. Pass on acquisition.

[EEAT website acquisitions expertise transfer](eeat-website-acquisitions-expertise-transfer.html) explains how **Amazon affiliate sites in YMYL categories** (health supplements, financial products) require credentialed authors post-acquisition.

## Keyword Cannibalization Analysis

**Amazon affiliate sites** often target overlapping keywords across multiple articles. A **tech site** publishes:
- "Best Budget Laptops 2026"
- "Top Cheap Laptops Under $500"
- "Affordable Laptop Reviews"

All three articles target **"budget laptops."** Google ranks **one page** and suppresses the others. The site **dilutes authority** across 3 URLs instead of consolidating into 1 high-authority page.

**Cannibalization detection**:
1. Export all URLs from Ahrefs or SEMrush
2. Group by target keyword (identify duplicates)
3. Check Google Search Console (Performance > Queries > filter by keyword, see which URLs rank)

**Resolution strategy** (post-acquisition):
- Designate **one canonical page** per keyword cluster
- 301 redirect competing pages to canonical (preserves backlinks, consolidates authority)
- Rewrite canonical page to include all relevant info from redirected pages

A **$5K/month Amazon site** with **40% keyword cannibalization** gains **15-25% traffic** post-cleanup. The fix costs **$1,500-$3,000** (SEO audit + redirects) but increases revenue **$750-$1,250/month** = 6-10 month ROI.

[Economics of internal linking](economics-of-internal-linking.html) explains how **strategic internal linking** prevents cannibalization by signaling topical hierarchy to Google.

## Diversification Risk Assessment

**Amazon-only income = single point of failure**. Buyers prefer sites with:
- 40-60% Amazon affiliate revenue
- 20-30% direct affiliate revenue (ShareASale, CJ, Impact)
- 10-20% display ad revenue (Mediavine, AdThrive)
- 10-20% email monetization or info products

**Pure Amazon affiliate sites** suffer from:
- **Commission rate cuts** (Amazon reduced rates 50% in 2020, could repeat)
- **Account termination risk** (TOS violation, wrongful ban)
- **24-hour cookie limitation** (compared to 30-90 day cookies elsewhere)

**Diversification audit**:
1. Request **income breakdown** (% from Amazon vs other sources)
2. Identify **products with direct affiliate programs** (replace Amazon links where higher commissions exist)
3. Evaluate **display ad eligibility** (does site meet Mediavine 50K session threshold?)

A **$10K/month Amazon affiliate site** (100% Amazon revenue) undergoes diversification:
- Replace **home improvement product links** with **Home Depot affiliate links** (5-8% commission vs Amazon's 4%)
- Add **Mediavine ads** (site has 80K monthly sessions, qualifies) = **$2,500/month display revenue**
- Launch **email list** with content upgrades = **$1,000/month email affiliate revenue**

**Post-diversification revenue**: $10K Amazon + $2.5K Mediavine + $1K email = **$13.5K/month** (35% revenue increase).

**Valuation impact**: Diversified income raises multiple from **30-32X** (Amazon-only) to **35-38X** (multi-channel). On $13.5K/month revenue, diversification creates **$100K-$150K enterprise value gain**.

[Ecommerce SEO vs content site valuation](ecommerce-seo-vs-content-site-valuation.html) explains how **revenue diversification** affects content site multiples during acquisition.

## Backlink Profile Analysis

**Amazon affiliate sites** attract **toxic backlinks** from:
- Comment spam (forum posts with affiliate links)
- PBN links (private blog networks selling backlinks)
- Link exchanges (reciprocal linking schemes)

**Toxic backlinks** trigger **Google penalties** (algorithmic suppression or manual action). A site ranking #1-3 for "best running shoes" drops to #15-20 post-penalty, losing **70-90% traffic**.

**Backlink audit process**:
1. Export backlink profile from Ahrefs (Backlinks > Export)
2. Filter by **spam score >50%** (Ahrefs flags toxic links)
3. Identify **exact match anchor text >30%** (over-optimization signal)
4. Check for **PBN patterns** (same IP addresses, identical footprints)

**Disavow file creation**:
- List toxic domains in disavow.txt
- Submit to Google via Search Console (Disavow Links tool)
- Wait 30-60 days for recrawl and penalty lift

A **$7K/month Amazon site** audit reveals:
- **200 toxic backlinks** from forum spam
- **15% exact match anchors** "best budget laptops" (over-optimized)
- Site received **manual action warning** (unnatural links)

**Buyer options**:
1. Walk from deal (penalty risk too high)
2. Negotiate **30% price reduction** + require seller submit disavow file
3. Require seller lift penalty **before** escrow release

**Penalty lift timeline**: 60-90 days. Buyer waits for Search Console "Manual action revoked" message before approving escrow.

[Exit timing SEO sites](exit-timing-seo-sites.html) discusses how **backlink health** affects buyer confidence and acquisition multiples.

## Mobile Usability and Core Web Vitals

**Amazon affiliate sites** monetize mobile traffic (60-70% of sessions). **Google's mobile-first indexing** (2019+) penalizes sites with:
- Poor mobile UX (buttons too small, text unreadable)
- Slow page speed (>3 second load time)
- Failed Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS metrics)

**Mobile audit**:
1. Test site on mobile device (actual phone, not desktop emulator)
2. Check **Core Web Vitals** in Google Search Console (Experience > Core Web Vitals)
3. Run **PageSpeed Insights** (scores 90+ = good, <50 = poor)

**Common mobile issues**:
- **Oversized images** (3MB images cause slow load)
- **Render-blocking JavaScript** (Amazon OneLink script delays page render)
- **Intrusive ads** (popups, auto-play videos)
- **Non-responsive design** (desktop layout doesn't adapt to mobile)

A **$9K/month Amazon site** fails mobile audit:
- **PageSpeed score: 32** (poor)
- **LCP: 4.8 seconds** (Google threshold: <2.5 seconds)
- 65% of traffic is mobile (**$5,850/month at risk**)

**Buyer response**: Require seller fix Core Web Vitals **before** escrow release, OR negotiate **$30-50K price reduction** (cost to hire developer + lost revenue during fix).

**Fix cost**: $2,000-$5,000 (image optimization, lazy loading, CDN setup, code minification).

[Get accepted Mediavine strategy](get-accepted-mediavine-strategy.html) explains how **Core Web Vitals** affect Mediavine RPMs and ad placement optimization.

## Seasonality and Revenue Trends

**Amazon affiliate sites** often exhibit **seasonal revenue fluctuations**:
- **Q4 (Oct-Dec)**: +40-80% revenue (holiday shopping)
- **Q1 (Jan-Mar)**: -20-40% revenue (post-holiday lull)
- **Q2-Q3 (Apr-Sep)**: baseline revenue

**Seller manipulation tactic**: List site in **November-December** (peak revenue months) to inflate valuation. Buyer acquires in **January**, revenue drops 40%, and buyer realizes they overpaid.

**Buyer protection**:
1. Request **12-month revenue history** (not just 3-6 months)
2. Normalize revenue (average across 12 months, don't anchor on Q4 peak)
3. Adjust purchase price based on **annualized average** (not peak month)

**Example**:
- Seller lists site at **$10K/month** (December revenue)
- 12-month average: **$7K/month** (normalizing for seasonality)
- Valuation at 35X: $10K × 35 = $350K (seller asks)
- Valuation at 35X: $7K × 35 = $245K (fair price)

**Buyer saves $105K** by detecting seasonality inflation.

**Seasonal niches** (higher risk):
- Christmas/holiday products (90% revenue in Q4)
- Tax software affiliates (80% revenue in Q1-Q2)
- Back-to-school supplies (60% revenue in Jul-Sep)

**Year-round niches** (lower risk):
- Kitchen appliances, home improvement, fitness (consistent demand)

[Empire Flippers review sellers](empire-flippers-review-sellers.html) explains how **Empire Flippers adjusts valuations** for seasonal sites (lower multiples to account for revenue concentration).

## Legal and Compliance Checks

**Amazon Associates Operating Agreement** requires:
- **FTC disclosure** ("As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases")
- **Privacy policy** (disclose cookie usage, affiliate relationships)
- **Terms of service** (disclose affiliate nature of links)

**Buyer inherits compliance liability**. If seller failed to disclose affiliate relationships, **FTC can fine the buyer** post-acquisition ($5,000-$50,000 per violation).

**Compliance audit**:
1. Check every product review page for **FTC disclosure** (above the fold, clear language)
2. Verify **privacy policy** mentions Amazon Associates and cookies
3. Confirm **terms of service** exists and discloses affiliate links

**Non-compliant site example**:
- Zero FTC disclosures on any page
- No privacy policy
- Amazon affiliate links not disclosed

**Buyer response**: Require seller add disclosures **before** escrow release, OR negotiate **$10-20K price reduction** (legal compliance cost + FTC risk).

**Disclosure implementation cost**: $500-$1,500 (lawyer drafts policy, developer adds disclosure to templates).

[FTC affiliate disclosure requirements](ftc-affiliate-disclosure-requirements.html) provides **disclosure templates** and placement guidance for Amazon affiliate sites.

## Conclusion

**Amazon affiliate site evaluation** requires multi-layer audit:
1. **Traffic sources** (90%+ organic = defensible, paid traffic = TOS violation)
2. **Commission rates** (verify actual categories, not inflated screenshots)
3. **TOS compliance** (cookie stuffing, incentivized traffic = account termination risk)
4. **Content quality** (firsthand reviews, original images, <18 months old)
5. **Keyword cannibalization** (consolidate competing pages, gain 15-25% traffic)
6. **Diversification** (Amazon-only = high risk, multi-channel = 35% higher revenue)
7. **Backlink profile** (toxic links = penalty risk, disavow before acquisition)
8. **Mobile UX** (Core Web Vitals = 60-70% of revenue)
9. **Seasonality** (normalize 12-month average, avoid Q4 inflation)
10. **Legal compliance** (FTC disclosures = $5K-$50K fine risk)

**Amazon affiliate sites** trade at **28-35X multiples** (lower than display ad sites at 35-42X) because:
- Commission rate cut risk (Amazon controls rates)
- Account termination risk (TOS violations, wrongful bans)
- 24-hour cookie limitation (attribution loss)
- Diversification complexity (replacing Amazon links with direct affiliates)

Buyers acquiring **diversified sites** (40-60% Amazon, 40-60% other channels) pay **32-38X** because risk spreads across income sources. Buyers acquiring **Amazon-only sites** pay **28-32X** because single point of failure compresses valuation.

**Due diligence cost**: $2,000-$5,000 (SEO audit, legal review, backlink analysis). **Due diligence ROI**: Prevents **$50K-$200K overpayment** by detecting seasonality inflation, TOS violations, or penalty risk.

## FAQ

**What's a safe percentage of revenue from Amazon Associates?**
40-60% Amazon is ideal. Below 40%, you're underutilizing Amazon's conversion power. Above 60%, you're over-exposed to commission cuts and account termination risk. Diversify with direct affiliate programs (5-8% commissions) and display ads (Mediavine, AdThrive).

**How do I verify Amazon affiliate earnings aren't inflated?**
Request 90-day Amazon Associates dashboard access (not screenshots). Download Product Linking Report showing actual commission categories and rates. Compare reported earnings to payout history. Sellers inflating earnings count $0-commission sales (Prime signups, gift cards) as revenue.

**What's the biggest risk in acquiring an Amazon affiliate site?**
Amazon account termination. If the seller violated TOS (cookie stuffing, incentivized traffic, paid ads to affiliate links) and Amazon terminates the account post-acquisition, buyer loses 100% revenue with no recourse. Audit TOS compliance before acquisition—request Amazon account health status and review historical marketing tactics.

**Should I buy an Amazon affiliate site in a YMYL niche?**
Only if the site has credentialed authors. Health and finance Amazon sites require EEAT (MD, RD, CPA bylines). Acquiring a YMYL site without credentials means 20-40% traffic loss post-acquisition unless you hire credentialed authors ($2,000-$5,000/month). Non-YMYL niches (hobbies, home improvement) have lower author requirements.

**How do I improve an Amazon affiliate site post-acquisition?**
Diversify income (add direct affiliate programs with higher commissions, apply for Mediavine/AdThrive if traffic qualifies), refresh content (update stale articles, add original images, improve product comparison depth), fix technical SEO (Core Web Vitals, mobile UX), launch email list (content upgrades, email affiliate promotions). These tactics increase revenue 30-50% within 6-12 months.
