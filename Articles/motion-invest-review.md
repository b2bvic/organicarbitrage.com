# Motion Invest Review: Marketplace Fees, Approval Rates, and Seller Experience

**Motion Invest** operates as a mid-market content site broker specializing in $5,000-500,000 acquisitions—charging sellers 10-15% commission (tiered by sale price) while providing 7-21 day transaction timelines through proprietary buyer network and expedited due diligence. The platform approved 18-25% of submitted sites in 2024-2025, rejecting properties with traffic declines, thin content, or questionable link profiles. Sellers choosing Motion Invest trade higher commission rates (vs 5-8% at Empire Flippers for similar-sized deals) for faster liquidity and lower listing requirements than alternatives.

## Commission Structure and Fee Comparison

**Motion Invest fee tiers:**
- **$5,000-50,000 sale price:** 15% commission
- **$50,001-100,000:** 12.5% commission
- **$100,001-300,000:** 10% commission
- **$300,001+:** Negotiable (typically 8-10%)

**Example sale calculations:**

**$35,000 sale:**
- Commission: $5,250 (15%)
- Net to seller: $29,750

**$85,000 sale:**
- Commission: $10,625 (12.5%)
- Net to seller: $74,375

**$180,000 sale:**
- Commission: $18,000 (10%)
- Net to seller: $162,000

**Marketplace comparison:**

| Marketplace | Commission | Sale Timeline | Traffic Minimum |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Motion Invest** | 10-15% | 7-21 days | 5,000+ monthly visits |
| **Empire Flippers** | 8-15% | 30-90 days | 10,000+ monthly visits |
| **Flippa** | 5-10% | 15-60 days | No minimum |
| **FE International** | 10-15% | 60-120 days | $50,000+ annual profit |
| **Quiet Light** | 10-15% | 60-120 days | $30,000+ annual profit |

**Motion Invest's value proposition:**
- **Speed:** 2-4x faster than traditional brokers (Empire Flippers, FE International)
- **Lower barriers:** Accepts smaller sites ($5,000+) vs FE International ($300,000+ typical)
- **Transaction certainty:** Buyer pool pre-qualified, higher close rates (85-90% vs 60-70% on Flippa)

**Commission justification:** Faster sales mean earlier capital deployment—selling in 14 days vs 60 days lets you reinvest capital 46 days sooner. At 20% annual return, those 46 days generate ~2.5% opportunity cost. A 12% Motion Invest commission vs 8% Empire Flippers commission only costs 4% if speed advantage recovers 2.5% through earlier reinvestment.

3. **Thin content:** <30 articles, average word count <800, obvious content farms (20% of rejections)

## Valuation Methodology and Multiple Expectations

**Standard valuation formula:**
```
(Average monthly profit × 12 months) × Multiple = Listing price
```

**Multiple ranges by site characteristics:**

**High-quality sites (36-42x monthly profit):**
- Traffic growing 15%+ year-over-year
- 80%+ organic traffic
- Strong backlink profile (DR 40+, 100+ referring domains)
- Diversified monetization (2-3 revenue streams)
- Minimal owner involvement (<5 hours monthly)

**Average sites (30-36x monthly profit):**
- Stable traffic (±10% year-over-year)
- 60-80% organic traffic
- Decent backlinks (DR 30-40, 50-100 referring domains)
- Single primary monetization
- Moderate owner involvement (8-15 hours monthly)

**Lower-quality sites (24-30x monthly profit):**
- Traffic flat or declining slightly
- <60% organic traffic or high social dependency
- Weak backlinks (DR <30, <50 referring domains)
- Single monetization, questionable sustainability
- High owner involvement (20+ hours monthly)

**Example valuations:**

**Site A:** $2,400 monthly profit, traffic +18% YoY, DR 42, 85% organic
- **Multiple:** 38x
- **Listing price:** $109,200

**Site B:** $1,800 monthly profit, traffic +2% YoY, DR 34, 72% organic
- **Multiple:** 32x
- **Listing price:** $69,120

**Site C:** $950 monthly profit, traffic -8% YoY, DR 28, 58% organic
- **Multiple:** 26x
- **Listing price:** $29,640

Motion Invest's multiples run 5-15% lower than Empire Flippers for comparable sites—reflecting faster sales timeline (lower multiples compensate buyers for reduced due diligence time).

## Transaction Process and Timeline

**Post-approval listing phase (Day 1-3):**
- Site appears in Motion Invest marketplace
- Description highlights key metrics (traffic, revenue, niche)
- Initial buyer inquiries begin immediately

**Offer phase (Day 2-7):**
- Qualified buyers submit offers
- Motion Invest facilitates negotiation
- Typical offers: 85-100% of asking price (listings priced accurately sell near ask)

**Due diligence period (Day 8-14):**
- Buyer conducts technical audit
- Buyer verifies revenue and traffic claims
- Escrow funds deposited (via Escrow.com)
- Seller maintains site operation, no changes allowed

**Asset transfer phase (Day 15-21):**
- Domain transfer (registrar access provided to buyer)
- Hosting transfer or migration
- Social media account handoffs
- Email list transfers
- Monetization account transitions (AdSense, affiliate networks)

**Closing (Day 21):**
- Buyer confirms receipt of all assets
- Escrow releases funds to seller
- Motion Invest deducts commission
- Seller receives net proceeds (ACH or wire)

**Potential delays:**
- **Domain transfer issues:** Registrar delays (5-7 days for .com transfers with auth codes)
- **Monetization account transfers:** AdSense requires 2-4 weeks (some sellers keep AdSense, buyer sets up new account)
- **Buyer financing:** If buyer needs SBA loan approval (extends timeline 30-45 days)

## Buyer Pool and Market Dynamics

**Motion Invest buyer composition:**
- **Individual investors:** 65% (buying 1-3 sites annually for portfolio income)
- **Portfolio operators:** 25% (managing 10-30 sites, buying 6-12 annually)
- **Institutions/funds:** 10% (aggregator platforms, private equity)

**Buyer preferences:**
- **Niche focus:** Finance, health, home improvement, SaaS reviews, parenting/lifestyle
- **Monetization:** Display ads (Mediavine/AdThrive) preferred over pure affiliate (more stable)
- **Traffic:** Organic-heavy (70%+ from search), social-dependent sites less desirable
- **Content depth:** 50-150 articles ideal (enough authority, not overwhelming to manage)

**Competitive dynamics:**
Average listing receives 8-15 serious inquiries within 7 days. High-quality listings (38-42x multiples) often receive multiple offers, creating bidding competition that pushes final price 3-8% above ask.

**Seasonality:**
- **Q1 (Jan-Mar):** High buyer activity (new year capital deployment, tax refund season)
- **Q2 (Apr-Jun):** Moderate activity
- **Q3 (Jul-Sep):** Slower (summer vacations, back-to-school distractions)
- **Q4 (Oct-Dec):** Moderate to high (year-end portfolio optimization)

**Optimal listing timing:** January-February or October-November when buyer liquidity peaks.

## FAQ

### Can you negotiate Motion Invest's commission rates?

Limited negotiation room. For sales under $100,000, commission is fixed (15% for sub-$50K, 12.5% for $50K-100K). Sales over $100,000 may negotiate down to 8-9% if the site is exceptionally easy to sell (high demand niche, clean metrics, multiple offers expected). Don't expect to negotiate below 8%—Motion Invest's speed and buyer network justify the premium vs DIY listing.

### How accurate are Motion Invest's valuation estimates?

Within 10-15% of final sale price for 70% of listings. Their valuations reflect current market conditions and recent comparable sales. If Motion Invest suggests listing at $75,000 and you counter at $95,000, expect slower sale timeline or price reduction after 14 days without offers. Trust their guidance—they have real-time market data you don't.

### What happens if your site doesn't sell?

No upfront fees, so no cost if unsold. After 60 days with no offers, Motion Invest may suggest: (1) Price reduction (10-20% lower), (2) De-listing for 30-60 days to improve metrics, (3) Switching to Empire Flippers or Flippa for broader buyer pool. Sites that don't sell on Motion Invest usually have fundamental issues (declining traffic, weak monetization, overpriced) rather than marketplace problems.

### Should you improve your site before listing or sell as-is?

Depends on time horizon. If you can invest 2-3 months improving traffic (+15-20% growth) or monetization (AdSense → Mediavine upgrade), do it—the valuation increase (potentially 25-40% higher sale price) exceeds the delay cost. If you need liquidity now or lack capital for improvements, sell as-is. Don't make minor cosmetic improvements (new logo, theme change)—buyers don't value these and you'll waste time.

### Do Motion Invest sales close more reliably than Flippa?

Yes—85-90% of accepted offers close on Motion Invest vs 60-70% on Flippa. Motion Invest pre-qualifies buyers (verifying capital availability, portfolio intent) and provides faster due diligence (buyers can't drag out inspection periods indefinitely). Flippa's open marketplace includes less serious buyers—tire-kickers, competitors gathering intelligence, buyers without capital. The higher close rate justifies Motion Invest's commission premium.
