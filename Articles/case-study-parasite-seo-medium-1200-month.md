# Parasite SEO Case Study: $1,200/Month from Medium Articles in 6 Months

**Parasite SEO** leverages the domain authority of established platforms to rank content you don't own. Instead of building a site from scratch and waiting 12-18 months for authority, you publish on platforms with Domain Rating 85-95 and rank in weeks.

Between July 2024 and January 2025, I published 47 articles on **Medium** targeting affiliate keywords in the productivity and software niches. Total investment: $940 (content production). Current monthly revenue: $1,200 from affiliate commissions. ROI: 127% monthly return on capital.

This case study maps the keyword selection strategy, content optimization tactics, and monetization structure that turned a high-authority platform into a cash-flowing affiliate engine with zero hosting costs.

## Why Medium Works for Parasite SEO

**Medium** (DR 94 in Ahrefs) has three attributes that make it ideal for parasite SEO:

**1. Instant authority inheritance:** Articles published on Medium.com inherit the root domain's authority. Google treats them as subpages of a DR 94 site, not new content on a fresh domain.

**2. Indexing speed:** New Medium articles typically index within 24-72 hours. Compare this to new domains, which can take 30-90 days before Google trusts them enough to rank.

**3. No hosting or technical overhead:** Medium handles speed optimization, mobile responsiveness, SSL, and uptime. You focus entirely on content and promotion.

**The trade-off:** You don't own the platform. Medium can delete your account, change monetization rules, or deprioritize your content. This makes parasite SEO a **short-to-medium term arbitrage play** (6-24 months), not a long-term asset. Treat it as a capital-efficient revenue generator while you build owned properties.

## Keyword Selection: Affiliate Intent with Low Competition

I targeted keywords with three characteristics:

**1. Commercial intent:** Keywords indicating buyer readiness ("best," "vs," "alternative," "review," "pricing").

**2. Low competition:** Keyword Difficulty (KD) <30 in Ahrefs. Most DR 50+ sites ignore these keywords because volume is low (500-2,000 monthly searches). But Medium's DR 94 crushes them.

**3. Affiliate programs available:** Products with established affiliate programs paying 20-50% commissions (SaaS tools, productivity apps, courses).

**Example keyword cluster (productivity tools):**
- "best alternative to Notion" (KD 28, 1,200 searches/month)
- "Notion vs Obsidian" (KD 22, 800 searches/month)
- "Roam Research pricing 2024" (KD 18, 600 searches/month)
- "best knowledge management tools for developers" (KD 25, 900 searches/month)

**Keyword research process:**

1. Started with seed keywords in Ahrefs Keywords Explorer: "best," "alternative," "vs," "review," "pricing"
2. Filtered for KD <30, volume >500 searches/month
3. Checked SERP overview for each keyword—looked for DR 40-60 sites ranking in positions 1-3 (signal that Medium's DR 94 could dominate)
4. Cross-referenced with affiliate programs (PartnerStack, Impact, individual SaaS affiliate pages)
5. Prioritized keywords with 3+ affiliate offers available (diversifies revenue, reduces dependency on one program)

**Total keyword list:** 52 keywords across productivity, project management, note-taking, and writing tools niches.

**Projected monthly volume:** 38,000 combined searches across all 52 keywords.

## Content Production: Optimized for Medium's Algorithm

Medium's algorithm rewards **engagement metrics** (claps, comments, reading time) more than traditional SEO signals. But ranking in Google requires a different approach than ranking in Medium's internal feed.

**For Google rankings, I optimized:**

**Title structure:** [Target Keyword] + [Year] + [Qualifier]
- "Best Notion Alternatives in 2024 (Free & Paid Options)"
- "Obsidian vs Roam Research: Which PKM Tool is Better in 2024?"

**Subtitle:** Expanded value proposition with semantic keywords
- "I tested 11 knowledge management tools over 90 days. Here's what works for developers, writers, and researchers."

**Headings (H2/H3):** Keyword-rich, structured as questions or comparisons
- "Why You Might Need a Notion Alternative"
- "Obsidian: Best for Privacy-Focused Users"
- "Pricing Comparison: Notion vs. Alternatives"

**Content length:** 1,800-2,400 words (longer than typical Medium articles, better for Google)

**Internal structure:**
- Intro (150-200 words): Problem statement + what article delivers
- Comparison table (top of article, before deep dives)
- Individual tool breakdowns (300-400 words each)
- Pros/cons lists (bullet format)
- FAQ section (4-5 questions, answers 100-150 words each)
- Conclusion with recommendation (150 words)

**Affiliate link placement:**
- 1 link in intro (contextual mention)
- 1 link per tool breakdown (CTA button using Medium's embed feature)
- 1 link in conclusion
- Disclosure statement at top of article: "This article contains affiliate links. I earn a commission if you purchase, at no extra cost to you."

**For Medium's internal algorithm, I optimized:**

**Tags:** Used all 5 available tags (max allowed by Medium)
- Primary tag: target keyword (e.g., "Notion Alternatives")
- Secondary tags: related topics (e.g., "Productivity," "Software Reviews," "Knowledge Management")

**Reading time:** Aimed for 7-10 minute read time (Medium's algorithm favors 7+ minutes)

**Engagement hooks:**
- Asked questions in first 3 paragraphs (e.g., "Have you ever lost critical notes because your tool didn't sync properly?")
- Embedded polls (Medium feature) in 12 articles to boost interaction
- Included 2-3 images per article (comparison screenshots, tool interfaces)

**Publishing cadence:** 2-3 articles per week. Avoided publishing more than 1 per day (Medium flags accounts that publish too aggressively).

**Outsourcing:** Hired 2 writers on Upwork at $0.08/word. I provided keyword, outline, and affiliate links. They wrote first drafts. I edited for voice, added personal anecdotes, optimized for SEO.

**Total content cost:** $940 (47 articles × $20 average per article after editing).

## Promotion Strategy: Getting Articles in Front of Google

Medium articles don't automatically rank in Google just because they're on a DR 94 domain. You still need external signals to push them into top positions.

**Tactic 1: Cross-linking between Medium articles**

After publishing 10 articles, I went back and added internal links. Each article linked to 3-5 related articles in my cluster. This created a topical authority network within Medium.

Example: "Best Notion Alternatives" article linked to "Notion vs Obsidian," "Notion Pricing Breakdown," "Why I Switched from Notion to Obsidian."

**Tactic 2: Social shares (Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit)**

Shared each article on:
- **Twitter** (my account, 1,800 followers): got 20-50 clicks per post
- **LinkedIn** (my network, 2,400 connections): got 40-80 clicks per post
- **Reddit** (relevant subreddits like r/productivity, r/ObsidianMD): got 100-300 clicks per post (posted sparingly to avoid spam flags)

Social shares don't directly impact Google rankings, but they drive initial traffic. Medium's algorithm interprets this as "engagement," which boosts the article in Medium's internal feed, which generates more organic claps/comments, which Google notices.

**Tactic 3: Editorial backlinks from owned properties**

I own 3 niche blogs (not related to this case study). I added contextual links from those blogs to my Medium articles. Example: A blog post about productivity habits included a link to my "Best Notion Alternatives" Medium article.

Result: 8-12 referring domains pointing to my Medium articles (low quantity, but enough to signal relevance to Google).

**Tactic 4: Quora answers linking to Medium**

Answered 15-20 Quora questions related to my keywords. Each answer included a link to the relevant Medium article. Example: Quora question "What's a good alternative to Notion?" → my answer (150-200 words) → link to "Best Notion Alternatives in 2024" article.

Quora links are nofollow, but they drive traffic and engagement, which indirectly helps rankings.

## Monetization Breakdown: Affiliate Offers and Conversion Rates

**Primary affiliate programs:**

1. **PartnerStack** (Notion, ClickUp, Airtable, others)
   - Commission: 20-30% of first-year subscription
   - Average payout per conversion: $35
   - Conversions (Month 6): 18
   - Revenue: $630

2. **AppSumo** (lifetime deal software)
   - Commission: 50% of sale price
   - Average payout per conversion: $28
   - Conversions (Month 6): 8
   - Revenue: $224

3. **Individual SaaS affiliate programs** (Obsidian Sync, Roam Research, Mem.ai)
   - Commission: 20-40% recurring
   - Average payout per conversion: $22
   - Conversions (Month 6): 8
   - Revenue: $176

   - Commission: 3-10% depending on category
   - Average payout per conversion: $8
   - Conversions (Month 6): 22
   - Revenue: $170

**Key insight:** Low overall conversion rate is expected for affiliate content. The leverage comes from Medium's authority allowing you to rank for dozens of keywords with minimal investment.

## What Worked: Repeatable Tactics

**1. Target low-KD, high-intent keywords**

Keywords with KD <30 are "too small" for most DR 60+ sites to bother with, but they're perfect for parasite SEO. Medium's DR 94 crushes these keywords with minimal promotion.

**2. Cross-link aggressively within Medium**

After publishing 10+ articles, I went back and interlinked them. Google noticed the topical clusters and ranked them higher. Articles with 5+ internal links outperformed those with 0-1 links by 40% on average.

**3. Update articles with current-year pricing/features**

I updated 6 articles in December 2024 to reflect "2025" pricing and new features. These updates pushed them back into Google's "freshness" rotation, increasing impressions by 30% for those articles.

**4. Use comparison tables at the top of articles**

Articles with comparison tables in the first 300 words had 25% higher click-through rates from Google. Readers immediately saw value and stayed on the page longer (better engagement signals).

**5. Leverage Medium's internal distribution**

Publishing 2-3x per week kept my articles in Medium's "recommended" feed longer. This drove initial traffic, which triggered engagement metrics, which Google noticed.

## What Didn't Work: Mistakes and Adjustments

**Mistake 1: Published too aggressively in Week 1**

Published 5 articles in 3 days. Medium flagged my account for "spam-like behavior." Had to slow down to 2-3 articles per week. Lesson: Medium monitors publishing velocity. Stay under 1 article per day.

**Mistake 2: Ignored SEO-focused titles in first 8 articles**

First batch of titles were "clever" but not keyword-rich (e.g., "Why Your Note-Taking App is Killing Your Productivity"). Google didn't rank them. Rewrote titles to include target keywords (e.g., "Best Notion Alternatives for Developers in 2024"). Rankings improved within 2 weeks.

**Mistake 3: Used too many affiliate links initially**

Early articles had 12-15 affiliate links. Medium's spam detection flagged 2 articles and removed them from public view. I reduced to 5-7 links per article. Articles were reinstated after I appealed.

**Mistake 4: Didn't add FAQs until Month 4**

Articles without FAQ sections ranked lower. After adding FAQ sections to 12 articles, 9 of them moved from positions 6-10 to positions 2-4 within 30 days. Lesson: FAQ schema markup (even on Medium) helps Google understand content better.

**Mistake 5: Targeted some keywords with KD 35-40**

These keywords had too much competition. Even Medium's DR 94 couldn't crack positions 1-5. Wasted time on 6 articles that never generated traffic. Lesson: Stay strict with KD <30 threshold.

## Risks of Parasite SEO: Why This Isn't Forever

**Risk 1: Platform policy changes**

Medium can change its affiliate link policy, delete your account, or deprioritize articles at any time. You have zero control. This happened to many LinkedIn newsletter publishers in 2023 when LinkedIn changed its algorithm.

**Mitigation:** Treat parasite SEO as a temporary arbitrage. Use the revenue to fund owned properties (domains you control).

**Risk 2: Google penalizes the host platform**

If Google decides Medium (or any platform) is hosting too much low-quality affiliate content, it could derank the entire domain. Your articles would tank overnight.

**Mitigation:** Diversify across multiple platforms (Medium, LinkedIn, Substack, Quora) and owned domains. Don't put 100% of content on one platform.

**Risk 3: Affiliate programs shut down**

Several SaaS companies paused or closed their affiliate programs in 2024 (Notion briefly paused new affiliate signups). If your primary revenue source closes its program, revenue drops to zero.

**Mitigation:** Promote 3+ affiliate offers per article. If one program shuts down, you still have 2 others generating revenue.

**Risk 4: Competition increases**

As more people discover parasite SEO, competition for low-KD keywords increases. Keywords that were KD 25 in July 2024 are now KD 32-35 in January 2025.

**Mitigation:** Stay ahead of trends. Target emerging tools and software (new launches often have zero competition for 6-12 months).

## Transition Strategy: From Parasite to Owned Asset

I treat Medium revenue as **bridge capital** to fund owned properties. Here's the transition plan:

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6):** Build Medium portfolio, generate $1,000-$1,500/month.

**Phase 2 (Months 7-12):** Use Medium revenue to fund owned domain. Purchase expired domain (DR 35-40) in productivity niche. Migrate top 10 performing Medium articles to owned domain (rewrite to avoid duplicate content). Continue publishing on Medium but shift 50% of effort to owned domain.

**Phase 3 (Months 13-18):** Owned domain generates $800-$1,200/month. Reduce Medium publishing to maintenance only (update existing articles, no new content). Focus 80% of effort on owned domain.

**Phase 4 (Months 19-24):** Owned domain surpasses Medium revenue. Treat Medium as passive income (minimal updates, no new content). Build owned domain to $3,000-$5,000/month. Sell for 30-36x multiple.

This strategy extracts maximum value from parasite SEO while building a long-term asset you control.

## Replication Framework: Your First Parasite SEO Campaign

**Step 1: Choose a platform**

Options: Medium, LinkedIn articles, Substack, Quora. I recommend Medium for beginners (easiest to rank in Google, largest built-in audience).

**Step 2: Research 30-50 keywords**

Use Ahrefs Keywords Explorer. Filter for KD <30, volume >500 searches/month, commercial intent keywords. Export to spreadsheet.

**Step 3: Verify affiliate programs**

Cross-reference keywords with affiliate networks (PartnerStack, ShareASale, Impact). Ensure each keyword has 2+ affiliate offers available.

**Step 4: Write or outsource 10 articles**

Aim for 1,800-2,400 words per article. Include comparison tables, FAQs, affiliate links (5-7 per article). Budget $15-$25 per article if outsourcing.

**Step 5: Publish 2-3 articles per week**

Avoid publishing >1 per day to prevent platform spam flags. Use all 5 tags per article (keyword + related topics).

**Step 6: Cross-link after 10 articles**

Add 3-5 internal links per article to related content in your cluster. This builds topical authority.

**Step 7: Promote via social and owned properties**

Share on Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit. Add links from owned blogs or Quora answers. Drive initial traffic to trigger engagement signals.

**Step 8: Monitor and optimize**

Check Google Search Console (link Medium account) after 30 days. Identify which articles rank positions 4-10. Update those articles with more detail, better titles, FAQ sections. Most will move to positions 1-3 within 2-4 weeks.

**Timeline:** Expect first $100-$200/month by Month 3. Scale to $800-$1,200/month by Month 6 if you publish 40-50 articles.

## FAQ: Parasite SEO on Medium

**Q: Is parasite SEO against Medium's terms of service?**

Medium allows affiliate links as long as you disclose them and don't spam. Avoid publishing >1 article per day, don't use excessive affiliate links (stay under 7-8 per article), and always include disclosure language. Thousands of Medium writers monetize with affiliate links successfully.

**Q: How long do Medium articles stay ranked in Google?**

Rankings typically last 12-24 months before competition increases or Google's algorithm changes. Treat this as a short-to-medium term strategy. Use revenue to fund owned domains for long-term asset building.

**Q: Can I do this without a Medium subscription?**

Yes, but subscriber-only articles get priority in Medium's internal feed. A $5/month subscription unlocks analytics and better distribution. ROI is worth it if you're serious about scaling this strategy.

**Q: What if Medium deletes my account?**

Diversify across multiple platforms (LinkedIn, Substack, Quora) and owned domains. Don't put 100% of content on one platform. Also, save all article drafts locally so you can republish on owned domains if needed.

**Q: Do I need a personal brand to make this work?**

No. My Medium account has 800 followers. Most traffic comes from Google, not Medium's internal feed. Focus on SEO optimization, not building a Medium audience. The leverage is Medium's DR 94, not your follower count.
