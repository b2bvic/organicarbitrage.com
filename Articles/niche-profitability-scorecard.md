# Niche Profitability Scorecard: Evaluating Content Site Opportunities

**Niche profitability scorecard** quantifies seven weighted factors—competition intensity (25%), monetization potential (20%), content production costs (15%), keyword breadth (15%), link building difficulty (10%), seasonality (10%), and legal/policy risk (5%)—producing 0-100 scores that predict 18-month ROI ranges. Most operators choose niches based on interest or competitor observation without systematic evaluation, discovering 12-18 months post-launch that monetization caps at $15 RPM or content costs consume 60% of revenue. Your niche selection determines whether $15,000 invested returns $8,000 (53% loss) or $65,000 (333% gain) over two years.

## Competition Intensity Analysis (25% Weight)

**Scoring methodology:**

**Competition Score = 100 - (Average KD × 1.4) - (Top 10 DR Average × 0.6)**

**Example calculations:**

**Niche A (Personal Finance):**
- Top 20 target keywords average KD: 68
- Top 10 SERP average DR: 72
- **Score:** 100 - (68 × 1.4) - (72 × 0.6) = 100 - 95.2 - 43.2 = **-38.4** (floor at 0)
- **Interpretation:** Extreme competition, near-impossible entry

**Niche B (Smart Home Devices):**
- Top 20 target keywords average KD: 42
- Top 10 SERP average DR: 48
- **Score:** 100 - (42 × 1.4) - (48 × 0.6) = 100 - 58.8 - 28.8 = **12.4**
- **Interpretation:** High competition, requires significant investment

**Niche C (Indoor Plant Care):**
- Top 20 target keywords average KD: 28
- Top 10 SERP average DR: 38
- **Score:** 100 - (28 × 1.4) - (38 × 0.6) = 100 - 39.2 - 22.8 = **38.0**
- **Interpretation:** Moderate competition, achievable entry

**Niche D (Sous Vide Cooking):**
- Top 20 target keywords average KD: 18
- Top 10 SERP average DR: 32
- **Score:** 100 - (18 × 1.4) - (32 × 0.6) = 100 - 25.2 - 19.2 = **55.6**
- **Interpretation:** Low competition, favorable entry conditions

**Scoring bands:**
- **0-15:** Extreme competition (requires $50,000+ and 24-36 months)
- **16-30:** High competition (requires $25,000-50,000 and 18-24 months)
- **31-50:** Moderate competition (requires $12,000-25,000 and 12-18 months)
- **51-70:** Low competition (requires $6,000-12,000 and 8-12 months)
- **71-100:** Minimal competition (requires $3,000-6,000 and 6-9 months)

- **85-90:** High content costs constrain production volume
- **<85:** Premium content requirements strain budgets

## Keyword Breadth and Content Depth (15% Weight)

**Keyword Breadth Score:**

**Score = (Total targetable keywords with >50 monthly searches) / 10**

Cap score at 100.

**Examples:**

**Broad niche (Project Management Software):**
- 1,200+ targetable keywords (comparisons, features, how-tos, integrations, alternatives)
- **Score:** 1200 / 10 = 120 (capped at 100)

**Moderate niche (Sous Vide Cooking):**
- 380 targetable keywords (equipment, recipes, techniques, comparisons)
- **Score:** 380 / 10 = **38**

**Narrow niche (Cold Plunge Tubs):**
- 95 targetable keywords (limited product types, basic how-tos)
- **Score:** 95 / 10 = **9.5**

**Scoring bands:**
- **80-100:** Extensive keyword breadth, 300-500+ article potential
- **50-80:** Strong breadth, 150-300 article potential
- **30-50:** Moderate breadth, 80-150 articles before saturation

- **<15:** Very narrow, 20-40 articles then saturated

**Content depth requirement multiplier:**

Adjust base score by content depth complexity:
- **Simple content (800-1,500 words sufficient):** 1.0x (no adjustment)
- **Moderate depth (1,500-2,500 words needed):** 0.85x (15% penalty)
- **Deep content (2,500-4,000 words needed):** 0.70x (30% penalty)
- **Extremely deep (4,000+ words):** 0.55x (45% penalty)

**Adjusted keyword breadth example:**

**Legal advice niche:**
- Base keywords: 520
- Base score: 52
- Depth requirement: 3,500+ words (extremely deep)
- **Adjusted score:** 52 × 0.55 = **28.6**

## Link Building Difficulty (10% Weight)

**Link Difficulty Score = 100 - (Average cost per DR40-50 link / 5)**

**Niche link cost analysis:**

- **Low competition (KD 20-35):** Need 30-50 links (1.0x)
- **Medium competition (KD 35-55):** Need 60-90 links (1.5x volume penalty)
- **High competition (KD 55-75):** Need 100-150 links (2.0x volume penalty)

**Combined link cost score:**

**Example:** Finance niche
- Per-link difficulty score: 5
- Competition requires 120 links (2.0x penalty)
- **Adjusted score:** 5 / 2.0 = **2.5**

## Seasonality and Revenue Stability (10% Weight)

**Seasonality Score:**

**Score = 100 - (Revenue Variance Percentage)**

Revenue variance = ((Peak Month - Trough Month) / Average Month) × 100

**Examples:**

**Year-round stable (Productivity Software):**
- Peak month: $8,200
- Trough month: $7,400
- Average: $7,800
- Variance: ((8200 - 7400) / 7800) × 100 = 10.3%
- **Score:** 100 - 10.3 = **89.7**

**Moderate seasonality (Fitness):**
- Peak month: $12,500 (January)
- Trough month: $6,800 (August)
- Average: $9,200
- Variance: ((12500 - 6800) / 9200) × 100 = 62%
- **Score:** 100 - 62 = **38**

**Extreme seasonality (Tax Software):**
- Peak month: $28,000 (March)
- Trough month: $2,400 (July)
- Average: $10,500
- Variance: ((28000 - 2400) / 10500) × 100 = 244%
- **Score:** 100 - 244 = **-144** (floor at 0)

**Scoring bands:**
- **80-100:** Minimal seasonality, stable year-round revenue
- **60-80:** Low seasonality, 15-25% variance
- **40-60:** Moderate seasonality, 30-50% variance
- **20-40:** High seasonality, 50-100% variance
- **0-20:** Extreme seasonality, >100% variance

## Composite Scorecard Calculation

**Formula:**

**Total Score = (Competition × 0.25) + (Monetization × 0.20) + (Content Cost × 0.15) + (Keyword Breadth × 0.15) + (Link Difficulty × 0.10) + (Seasonality × 0.10) + (Legal Risk × 0.05)**

**Example Niche: Indoor Plant Care**

- Competition: 38 (moderate)
- Monetization: 60 (mid-tier RPM + affiliate)
- Content Cost: 97 (low cost, $120 per article)
- Keyword Breadth: 48 (380 keywords, moderate depth)
- Link Difficulty: 68 ($160 per link average)
- Seasonality: 72 (spring spike, but year-round base)
- Legal Risk: 95 (no compliance issues)

**Total Score:**
(38 × 0.25) + (60 × 0.20) + (97 × 0.15) + (48 × 0.15) + (68 × 0.10) + (72 × 0.10) + (95 × 0.05)
= 9.5 + 12.0 + 14.55 + 7.2 + 6.8 + 7.2 + 4.75
= **62.0**

**Score interpretation:**
- **75-100:** Excellent opportunity, strong fundamentals across all factors
- **60-75:** Good opportunity, viable with proper execution
- **45-60:** Marginal opportunity, requires specific advantages or lower expectations
- **30-45:** Poor opportunity, significant headwinds in multiple areas
- **<30:** Avoid, fundamental issues make profitability unlikely

## FAQ

### Should you avoid niches scoring below 50?

Not automatically—low scores indicate challenging fundamentals, but specific operator advantages can overcome. If you have (1) existing domain authority in the niche, (2) owned link networks, (3) specialized content expertise reducing production costs, or (4) existing audience/email list, you can succeed where others fail. Use scores as baseline expectations, not absolute verdicts.

### How do you weigh factors differently for acquisition vs building from scratch?

**Acquisitions:** Increase competition weight to 35%, reduce content cost weight to 8% (existing content already built). **Building:** Keep standard weights—content costs matter more when producing 100-200 articles from zero.

### Can a niche score well but still fail?

Yes—scorecards measure fundamentals, not execution quality. A high-scoring niche (75) can fail with poor content, weak link building, or bad monetization optimization. Conversely, skilled operators can succeed in 55-scoring niches through superior execution. Scorecards predict probability, not certainty.

### Should you re-score niches annually?

Yes, especially competition and monetization factors. A niche scoring 68 in 2023 might score 48 in 2026 after competition intensified. Annual rescoring identifies deteriorating fundamentals before they destroy profitability. Some niches improve over time (new monetization options, competitors exit)—rescoring captures opportunities others miss.

### What's the minimum score to justify a $20,000+ investment?

**65+ for conservative operators**, **55+ for aggressive operators** with specific advantages. Below 55, expect 18-24 month breakeven timelines and higher failure risk (40-60% chance of not recovering investment). Above 70, 12-18 month breakeven becomes probable with competent execution. Scores above 80 are rare—when found, they represent genuine arbitrage opportunities that close quickly as competition enters.
