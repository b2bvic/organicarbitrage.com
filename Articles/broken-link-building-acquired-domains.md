# Broken Link Building on Acquired Domains — Reclaiming Lost Authority

**Broken backlinks** represent immediate, low-hanging link building opportunities on newly acquired domains. A site with 500 referring domains typically has 40-80 broken backlinks (8-16% of total profile) — links that once pointed to content that no longer exists due to URL changes, deleted pages, or migration errors. Each broken link from a DR 40+ domain that could be restored delivers $200-600 in equivalent link building value (cost to acquire comparable new link). For a typical $40,000 acquisition with 60 broken high-quality backlinks, systematic broken link reclamation recovers $12,000-36,000 in link equity within 60-90 days post-purchase — effectively reducing net acquisition cost by 30-50%.

The timing advantage: Broken link outreach has 3-5x higher success rate immediately post-acquisition versus months/years later. Linking site owners are more responsive when they learn domain changed hands ("new owner, fixing site, please update your link") versus generic broken link outreach. First 90 days post-acquisition is golden window for broken link recovery — after that, outreach response rates drop from 25-40% to 8-15% as urgency fades and links remain broken longer (sites stop caring about year-old broken links).

## Understanding Broken Backlink Profiles on Acquired Sites

Categorizing and prioritizing broken links for maximum efficiency.

### Common Causes of Broken Backlinks

**Why backlinks break during site lifecycle:**

**URL structure changes:**
- Previous owner migrated from WordPress to static site, changed permalink structure
- Platform migration altered URL patterns
- Domain consolidation merged sites imperfectly

**Content deletion:**
- Owner removed outdated content without redirects
- Seasonal content deleted after campaigns ended
- Legal/compliance removals

**Technical errors:**
- Server migrations broke redirect mappings
- HTTPS migration failed properly
- Subdomain consolidation without redirect rules

**Intentional abandonment:**
- Owner stopped SEO maintenance pre-sale
- Portfolio operator deprioritized link housekeeping
- Multiple ownership transfers compounded decay

**Key insight:** Broken links are gifts from lazy prior owners. Their negligence becomes your opportunity to reclaim $10,000-30,000 in link equity for $500-2,000 in outreach labor.

### Broken Link Categorization and Prioritization

Not all broken backlinks worth pursuing. **Triage by value and recoverability.**

**Tier 1: High-value, easy recovery (prioritize first):**
- DR 50+ linking domains
- Contextual editorial links
- Recent breaks (6-12 months)
- Active linking pages with traffic
- Clear topical relevance

**Expected recovery rate:** 35-50%
**ROI:** $400-800 per recovered link
**Time investment:** 15-20 minutes per link

**Tier 2: Medium-value, moderate recovery:**
- DR 30-50 linking domains
- Resource page links, directories
- Broken 12-24 months
- Active but low-traffic pages

**Expected recovery rate:** 20-30%
**ROI:** $150-400 per recovered link
**Time investment:** 10-15 minutes per link

**Tier 3: Low-value or difficult recovery (defer or skip):**
- DR <30 linking domains
- Sitewide links (footer/sidebar)
- Broken 24+ months
- Dead linking pages or foreign language sites

**Expected recovery rate:** 5-15%
**ROI:** $50-150 per recovered link
**Time investment:** 15-25 minutes per link

**Resource allocation:**
- Spend 70-80% of broken link budget on Tier 1 targets
- 20-30% on Tier 2 if time permits
- Ignore Tier 3 unless you have VA labor at $5-10/hour

## Broken Link Outreach Strategy

Crafting effective outreach that converts 25-40% of targets.

### Outreach Email Template Framework

**Subject line variants:**
- "Quick heads up about a broken link on [TheirSite.com]"
- "Broken link on your [Topic] article"
- "Found a 404 on your [Specific Page Title] page"

**Email body structure:**

Hi [FirstName],

I was reading your article "[Exact Article Title]" on [TheirSite.com] and noticed one of the links isn't working:

[Their linking page URL]
Links to → [Your broken URL] (404 error)

I recently acquired [YourDomain.com] and I'm in the process of fixing broken pages. I've updated that content here:

[Your new working URL]

Would you be willing to update the link? I think your readers would find the updated version helpful.

Thanks for considering,
[YourName]

**Why this works:**
- Lead with value
- Acknowledge acquisition
- No ask for new link
- Specific replacement URL
- Short (150-200 words)

**Follow-up sequence:**
- **Day 0:** Initial outreach
- **Day 7:** First follow-up
- **Day 14:** Final follow-up
- **Day 21:** Stop

**Response rate expectations:**
- Initial email: 15-25%
- After follow-ups: 25-40% total
- Link update rate: 20-35%

## FAQ

### How long after acquisition should you start broken link outreach?

30-60 days post-acquisition is optimal window. Wait 30 days: Allows time to audit site, identify broken links, create replacement content, set up redirects. Begin outreach Days 30-60: "New owner fixing site" story is fresh and authentic, linking sites are responsive. After Day 90: Response rates decline 30-40% as acquisition story loses urgency and credibility.

### Can you use broken link building on sites you don't own?

Yes, but effectiveness is 60-80% lower than post-acquisition reclamation. Traditional broken link building faces challenge: Linking sites have no reason to link to you. Post-acquisition advantage: You own the domain they're linking to — not asking for new link, just updating existing link's target URL (much lower friction). Success rate: 5-12% vs 20-35% for post-acquisition broken link reclamation.

### What if the site has hundreds of broken backlinks?

Prioritize ruthlessly — focus on top 50-100 highest-value targets. Broken link building has diminishing returns: First 30-50 recoveries deliver 70-80% of total value. Strategy: Tier 1 (DR 60+, 20-30 targets) → Operator handles personally. Tier 2 (DR 40-60, 50-80 targets) → VA handles. Tier 3 → Defer or ignore.

### Do you need to recreate exact original content or can you redirect to similar content?

Redirection to similar content works for 60-70% of broken link recoveries, exact recreation boosts success to 80-90% but costs 5-10x more effort. Decision rule: Exact recreation for multiple links pointing to same broken URL, DR 70+ links, or where no similar existing content exists. Redirect approach for single broken links with DR 30-50 where you have close-enough existing content.

### How do you handle broken links from sites in foreign languages?

Deprioritize unless site has significant international traffic. Foreign-language broken link outreach has 2-5% success rate (vs 20-35% English) due to language barriers and cultural differences. For most operators: Focus on English-language broken links exclusively. Foreign links represent <5% of total value and 40% of outreach effort — failed cost-benefit.
