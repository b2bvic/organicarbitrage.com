## SECTION 1: PROBLEM

*[Layout: Left-aligned text, 60% width. Breathing room.]*

You found a domain at auction. DR 42. 350 referring domains. The old site had real traffic.

You bid $850. Win. Spend $350 on content. Six months later: 300 visitors/month. $5.40 in monthly revenue.

Net loss: $1,020.

This happens because you evaluated the domain on what you could see (metrics) instead of what you couldn't (whether authority would actually transfer).

Domain rating doesn't predict traffic recovery. Backlink quality does. Niche alignment does. Monetization fit does.

You didn't run the spread calculation. You gambled.

---

## SECTION 2: AGITATE

*[Layout: Pull quote on right, stats on left]*

Every week, operators bid thousands on domains that will never recover. They check the DR, see a number that "looks good," and assume the rest will work itself out.

Here's what they miss:

**60% of auction domains** have backlink profiles poisoned by forum spam and blog comments.

**24+ months expired** cuts recovery probability in half—backlink value decays.

**Niche mismatch** means authority doesn't transfer. Building finance content on a cooking domain starts from zero.

**Traffic dropped before expiration?** Likely a manual penalty. Not natural expiration. Previous owner's problem becomes your problem.

The auction doesn't show you this. Ahrefs doesn't show you this. Your gut doesn't show you this.

A spread calculation shows you this.

## SECTION 3: SOLUTION

*[Layout: Centered heading, checklist-style deliverables]*

### The Expired Domain Profit Calculator

A Google Sheets framework that forces discipline into every acquisition decision.

**What You Get:**

**1. Acquisition Cost Template**
Input auction price, content budget, link building cost, tool allocation, and time investment. Formula calculates true all-in cost—not just the auction number you'll remember.

**2. 10-Point Backlink Audit Scorecard**
Rate editorial placement, niche relevance, spam ratio, anchor distribution, link source diversity, average linking DR, linking page traffic, recency, toxicity, and penalty signals. Score under 60? Walk away.

**3. Traffic Projection Model**
Conservative, moderate, and aggressive recovery rates with time-to-recovery estimates. Reality-checked: most domains recover 25-50% of peak. The calculator won't let you model 70%.

**4. Three Monetization Calculators**
Display ads (AdSense through AdThrive RPM ranges), affiliate revenue (conversion rate x commission), and lead gen (traffic x opt-in rate x lead value). Pick your model.

**5. Spread Calculator**
12-month revenue / total acquisition cost = spread ratio. Under 2x? Do not pursue. 2-3x? Marginal. 3-5x? Execute. Over 5x? Accelerate.

**6. Risk Adjustment Multipliers**
Algorithm volatility, monetization compliance, competition trend, content decay rate. Adjusts your spread for what could go wrong.

**7. Bid Ceiling Formula**
(Projected 12-month revenue / target spread) - restoration costs = maximum auction bid. The number you walk away at.

## SECTION 4: INTRIGUE

*[Layout: Case study cards, three columns]*

### What Happens When You Run the Numbers

**$400 in, $9,200 out.** Home improvement blog, DR 38, 400 RDs. Calculator showed 7x projected ROI. Actual: 23x. The backlink audit caught what metrics couldn't—clean profile, relevant niches. Execution matched projection.

**$1,200 in, $0 out.** Personal finance blog, DR 42, 350 RDs. Metrics looked identical to the winner. But the operator skipped the backlink audit. 60% forum spam. Penalty history visible in Archive.org traffic drop. Calculator would have killed the deal. Gut didn't.

**$600 in, $12,000 flip.** Outdoor recreation site, DR 31, 180 RDs. Lower metrics than the loser. But the spread calculation showed 4.5x hold ROI, 8x flip ROI. Sold at Month 12 for 28x monthly revenue.

The difference wasn't luck. It was whether they ran the calculation first.

## SECTION 5: PROOF

*[Layout: Testimonial blocks with avatar placeholders]*

### [Placeholder: Testimonial 1]
"[Quote about avoiding a bad domain purchase using the calculator]"
— [Name], [Site/Business]

### [Placeholder: Testimonial 2]
"[Quote about profitable acquisition validated by the framework]"
— [Name], [Site/Business]

### [Placeholder: Social Proof Element]
X domains evaluated | X profitable acquisitions | $X total recoveries

## SECTION 6: DE-RISK / DESIRE

*[Layout: Two columns. Left: future state. Right: "run the numbers."]*

### After Your First Calculation

You'll enter an auction knowing your max bid before anyone else bids. You'll pass on domains that everyone else fights over—because you saw the spread was 1.8x. You'll execute on domains others ignore—because you ran the backlink audit and found a clean profile hiding behind a low DR.

The calculator doesn't find deals for you. It kills the bad ones before they cost you money.

### The Math

Average losing domain play: -$1,200 (auction + restoration + 6 months wasted)
Calculator cost: $0

One avoided mistake pays for itself infinitely.

One validated acquisition with 3x+ spread? Now you're compounding.

### FAQ

**Q: Do I need Ahrefs to use this?**
A: The backlink audit requires access to backlink data. Ahrefs, Semrush, or Moz work. Free trial accounts are sufficient for evaluation.

**Q: How long does an evaluation take?**
A: 15-20 minutes per domain once you know the process. The first one takes longer as you learn the audit criteria.

**Q: What about domains under $200?**
A: Same framework applies. Lower acquisition cost means tighter spread requirements. Calculator adjusts.

**Q: Is this for beginners or experienced flippers?**
A: Both. Beginners avoid expensive mistakes. Experienced operators systematize what they've been doing by feel.

### About Section

Victor Romo builds systems for SEO operators. The Profit Calculator came from losing $1,020 on a domain that looked perfect but wasn't. The backlink audit would have caught it in 10 minutes.
